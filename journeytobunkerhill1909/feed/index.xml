					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for a great post! About 6-7 years ago, I was browsing the panoramic maps in the LOC when I came across the Worthington Gates 1909 map of Los Angeles. I was instantly captivated by it. Here was a Los Angeles that was completely unrecognizable to me. It was a fascinating discovery! I look back now, and chancing upon that 1909 map was definitely the genesis of my present obsession with pre-WWII Los Angeles.
Although the Worthington Gates is a nicer-looking map, I personally favor the Birdseye View, primarily because of its more accurate depiction of the 1909 &#034;Million Dollar Post Office&#034; (another little obsession of mine). It&#039;s a shame that it wasn&#039;t built up on Bunker Hill, because I&#039;m really curious what you&#039;d write about it!
