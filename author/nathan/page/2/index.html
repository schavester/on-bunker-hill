		<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3120/3223969201_e9166b9630_o.gif" alt="youthadmits!" height="200" width="207">1947project readers may remember <a href="http://1947project.blogspot.com/2005/11/hardly-love-match.html" title="kristallnacht47" target="_blank">this addition</a> that King of Historians <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/thedailymirror/" title="TheHarn" target="_blank">Larry Harnisch</a> made to the blog back in its earliest incarnation.  It’s the story of Gerald Richards, and, because you can read the story in full in the link, I’ll just toss out the particulars:</p>
<p>Gerald Richards is 19, and he hasn’t much in the world.  He has a .25 auto that he picked up in Japan during his tour in the Maritime Service, and he’s got George Kirtland, 24, who he picked up in New Orleans during his postwar wanderlust.  It’s 1947 and they’ve landed in Los Angeles—George is from Gardena, Gerald an Illinois boy—and George goes to visit Gerald at his digs in the Biltmore.  Gerald should have probably chosen somewhere less tony, because his argument over the $32 hotel bill resulted in his shooting the assistant manager in the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zilf/221204623/" title="BiltLobby" target="_blank">lobby</a>.  Once nabbed, he also copped to two more slayings—a Tom Nitsch in New Mexico, and LA’s own 52-year-old tailor Charles Vuykov, whose nude body was found on the floor of his room, 529 West Third.  </p>
<p>In the 47p post, Larry made mention of the manner in which the <i>Times</i> heads off homosexual implications in Richards’ Kirtland relationship; but then, what was 19-year-old Gerald doing in the apartment of a 50-something tailor?  Especially a nude one?</p>
<p>And let’s not let this particular address of Vuykov’s slip by…529 isn’t just <i>any</i> spot on West Third.  That shot reverberated across the four corners of Third and Grand. That’s the Lovejoy Hotel.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3324/3224441970_65eac1a3c5_o.gif" alt="LoveJoy" height="312" width="575"></p>
<p>The Lovejoy is announced May 1903:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3416/3223821591_abb53e79ed_o.gif" alt="pulledpermits" height="55" width="400"></p>
<p>142 rooms, divided into 78 apartments, it opens in November.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3360/3224702464_a0ce704135_o.gif" alt="LoveJ65" height="445" width="575"></p>
<p>It is immediately the scene of many a large society wedding, and home to the known (William O. Owen lived at the Lovejoy when it was finally decreed, in 1927, that it was in fact he who first reached the summit of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Teton" title="greatteat" target="_blank">Grand Teton</a>).</p>
<p>The Lovejoy is also a hotbed of lefty activity. It’s a center for the Equal Rights League and magnet for suffragists of various stripe. It’s where Professor Flinn’s “physical culture”&#157; class met in 1904. It also serves as the 1930s home for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_Against_War_and_Fascism" title="AL" target="_blank">American League Against War and Fascism</a>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3395/3223823909_626b907e8d_o.gif" alt="lookingdownGrand" height="385" width="575"></p>
<p>Above, looking north/east on Grand.  (Nice crenellated parapets. Despite being against war, its residents were probably glad for defensible battlements.)</p>
<p>Now you see Angels Flight Drugs:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3527/3224681028_22ca0dbee0_o.gif" alt="closer" height="325" width="432"></p>
<p>Now you don&#8217;t:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3357/3223844845_e6ef40864f_o.gif" alt="nowyoudont" height="394" width="575"></p>
<p>This being Third and Grand, the Lovejoy was also across the street from the <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/NugentNewGrand" title="crosstheSt" target="_blank">Nugent</a>.  Below, the Nugent is on the left, and we peer down to Olive&#8230;there&#8217;s the top of Angels Flight, its neighbor the <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/elksannex" title="elxaugogo" target="_blank">Elks Lodge</a>, and the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ice_nyne/1911639696/" title="EdisonBldg" target="_blank">Edison</a>/Metro Water <a href="http://www.you-are-here.com/broadway/metropolitan_water.html" title="MWD" target="_blank">Bldng</a> at <a href="http://www.andreas-praefcke.de/carthalia/usa/usa_losangeles_million.htm" title="milliondolla" target="_blank">Third and Broadway</a> in the distance.</p>

<p>And, in our continuing effort to get you oriented, endless maps.</p>
<p>From the Sanborn Fire Insurance maps, 1906:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3508/3224776638_a114727685_o.gif" alt="Sanborn06" height="464" width="439"></p>
<p>From the Birdseye:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3262/3224776594_7a6e59e4fa_o.gif" alt="3rdGrand09" height="346" width="454"></p>
<p>From the Baists Real Estate Atlas, 1926:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3366/3223918391_4fdc54ca3f_o.gif" alt="baistyboy" height="454" width="575"></p>
<p>And of course, the WPA model from 1940:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3436/3224776760_a8c458e64d_o.gif" alt="3andG" height="619" width="575"></p>
<p>Above, the Nugent has lost the top of its tower.  And is also apparently falling over.</p>
<p>The Lovejoy stands strong, though painted yellow, as per its reputation for hosting pacifists.</p>
<p>The 1960s saw its demolition, and in its place, in the early 80s, the erection of a similarly formidable fortress, Isozaki&#8217;s <a href="http://www.magazineusa.com/us/cityguide/show.aspx?state=ca&amp;unit=losangeles&amp;doc=17&amp;dsc=MOCA" title="iso" target="_blank">Museum of Contemporary Art</a>.  Through true to the Hill, it&#8217;s styled less like a castle than it is bunker-like.</p>

Thomas Major Jr., 34, a logger by profession, down from Vancouver to take in the town.  He was in the barroom at the Rollin Hotel, Third and Flower, when the cops came in to investigate a brawl, January 24, 1960.  They have a funny way of doing things up in British Columbia, apparently, for as the bulls were bracing some other bar patron, Major pulled out a gun, pointed it at the cops’ backs, and began pulling the trigger.  The cops heard the click-click of two empty chambers, turned, and fired seven shots at Major.</p>
<p>Major was hit seven times, taking four in the abdomen.  Detectives Pailing and Buckland, with Municipal Judge Griffith in tow, made a visit to Major’s bed in the prison ward at General Hospital, where they charged him with two counts of assault with intent to commit murder and one of violating the deadly weapons control law.</p>
<p>The GH docs had pulled all sorts of lead from Major, but there was still the matter of the bullet in Major’s <i>heart</i>.  Yes, normally a slug from a Parker-issued K-38 in the ticker is going to put you down for good.  But this one found its place there in an unsual way; one of those bullets to the abdomen apparently passed through the liver, entered a large vein and was pumped into the upper right chamber of the heart, passed through the valve to the lower left chamber, an in that ventricle there it sat.  Apparently you can’t just leave well enough alone, so someone had to go in and get the damn thing.</p>
<p>Enter Drs. <a href="http://ats.ctsnetjournals.org/cgi/content/full/66/6/2132" title="lymanplace" target="_blank">Lyman Brewer</a> and Ellsworth Wareham, of the <a href="http://www.whitememorial.com/about/history/index.php" title="CME" target="_blank">College of Medical Evangelists</a>.  They’d removed plenty of bullets from hearts using the old “closed-heart method,”&#157; but here thought they’d try something new—having a heart-lung machine on hand, they thought they’d throw that into the mix.  No more working without seeing what you’re doing:  with the heart-lung machine, the heart could be drained of blood, and the surgeon can see and feel what’s transpiring.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.llu.edu/news/today/mar0404/mc.html#1" title="DrJoan" target="_blank">Dr. Joan Coggin</a>, who assisted, also noted that they’ve established a new approach to heart surgery in that they incised the heart on the underside, and not in the front; the electrical pattern of the heart, as evidenced by their electrocardiogram, has shown that this method results in far less serious consequence to the heart during surgery.  </p>

<p>
All this medical breakthrough, and all because some liquored Canuck on Bunker Hill decided to blast away at the heat!

<p>A bit on the Hotel Rollin, as long as we’re here.  Its building permits are issued July 9, 1904.  Its two and three room suites are each furnished with bath and kitchen.</p>

		<p>The Holy Trinity of Noir:  the Tough Hood, the Tougher Cop, and the Dame.  The Dame—in peril, and perilous to know.</p>
<p>Tonight’s tale takes this Trinitarian shape, but contains, oddly, but two players.</p>
<p>Our first adherent is Mr. X., aka Tough Hood.  He heard the clip-clop of heels reverberate throught the misty night air of February 7, 1944.  He followed his prey—the Dame, in peril, to her pad, and once she was inside, he attacked!<br>
<img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3418/3199752825_8f6407d351_o.gif" alt="madbadanddangeroustoknow" height="72" width="288"><br>
Unfortunately for Tough Hood, Dame in peril, true to form, was perilous to know.  She was playing double duty as Tougher Cop.  Tough Hood had unwittingly attacked Miss Margaret Maguire, a deputy sheriff.  Mr. X ended up with only a purse strap, and a heart pumping blood and terror; Maguire chased him all the way out of the neighborhood.</p>
<p>Maguire lived at the Carleton (across the street from the <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/st_angelo" title="angieayangie" target="_blank">St. Angelo</a>).</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3300/3200599100_8b4b20099d_o.gif" alt="nojokesaboutyourdoorman" height="546" width="575"></p>
<p>With a nod to its severe symmetry, Corinthian columns, and pointy pediment, Hill chronicler Hylen made sure to photograph Carleton&#8217;s backside as to juxtapose Neoclassical majesty with good old American tenement living:<img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3347/3199753363_89b469c94a_o.gif" alt="boweryboyz" height="484" width="575"><br>
Some quick views of the east side of the 200 block of North Grand:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3493/3199824761_4478b3a6b6_o.gif" alt="fromthebe1909" align="left" height="211" width="327">At left, from the Birdseye, the block in 1909; it’s a bustling part of the world.</p>
<p>Below, the Sanborn Map, 1906.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3097/3200599620_5a6ce7b48a_o.gif" alt="block06" height="570" width="417"></p>
<p>In 1950, most of the block was gone.  Only the Carleton, and a paltry few other structures, remain:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3112/3200599586_2b32c2571e_o.gif" alt="block50" height="565" width="417"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By 1952, they’d broken ground on the <a href="http://www.you-are-here.com/los_angeles/hall_of.html" title="HOA" target="_blank">Hall of Administration</a>.  So the 1953 Sanborn Map would have nothing to show for the Carleton&#8217;s time on Earth.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Back when the New Year turned 2000, some sort of promised computronic glitch was supposed to send us back to 1900.  Remember that?  I booted up everything I could find, sat in a room full of Coleco Adams, VIC 20s and TI 99/4s, wearing a high starched collar and waiting for President McKinley to send wire that all was well.  It never happened.  <br>
<img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3333/3172450033_df7e07810f_o.gif" alt="bunkernewyear" height="347" width="575"><br>
I won’t say that I go through the same ritual <i>every</i> year, but it was hard not to plummet, turning as we were to 2009, deep into the wonder of 1909.  You may lose yourself in the limpid pools of your lover’s eyes, or the majesty of your maker’s sunsets; I was transported to the world of Los Angeles, 1909, courtesy the Western Lithograph Company.  Unfortunately, I came back.  So I’ll plop down in front of my beloved Apple Lisa, which once failed to transport me to 1900, and try and take you around a bit to Bunker Hill, 1909.</p>
<p>Our journey involves a map.  There are in fact two versions of the beast-in-question:  one published by the Birdseye View Publishing Company, which included a legend at the bottom.  Another variation without the legend, commonly known as the &quot;Worthington Gates,&quot; as it names its compiler, was published the same year by Birdseye (or &quot;Birds Eye&quot; as they&#8217;re called on the WG; it as well identifies itself as product of the Western Litho. Co.).     For the record, contrary to <a href="http://www.raremaps.com/cgi-bin/gallery.pl/detail/17811" title="mappy" target="_blank">popular belief</a>, these are not entirely the same map.  For example, here’s the corner of Fourth and Hill.  The Birdseye-View map:<br>
<img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3031/3168465543_5ca907c86e_o.gif" alt="bonzai" height="263" width="453"><br>
Now note the Worthington Gates—which we should note was also printed smaller, and in and of an overall brownish hue, as opposed to the verdant greens of Los Angeles in the Birdseye above—apparently published later:  while the buildings have remained untouched, their naming has altered slightly (the LAP building) and some names have been added (note Danziger and University Club to the north of the Wright-Callender).<br>
<img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3085/3168465805_3c145693d0_o.gif" alt="westernlitho" height="257" width="453"></p>
<p>Very well.  We commence our journey through the interstices of space-time!</p>
<p>From the get-go, let&#8217;s get a feeling for just how high the Hill once lorded over downtown:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3114/3168719263_1d602d51bf_o.gif" alt="lording" height="456" width="559"></p>
<p>Starting with our western edge:</p>

<p>Fifth and Olive, of course, the unassuming future site of the <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/Auditorium/SanCarlosHotel" title="SCH" target="_blank">Auditorium Hotel</a>, a mere year away.   In the future.  Heading up Olive into the Hill there&#8217;s our old friend the <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/hoteltrenton" title="Trenton" target="_blank">Trenton</a>.</p>
<p>Swinging around to our southern border:</p>

<p>Third and Grand at upper left, Third and Olive center, Third and Hill bottom right.  The <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/NugentNewGrand" title="theNuge" target="_blank">Nugent</a> stands proud at 3&amp;G; there&#8217;s <a href="http://jpg2.lapl.org/pics25/00047274.jpg" title="nicequoins" target="_blank">the</a> <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/elksannex" title="elx" target="_blank">Elks</a>, <a href="http://jpg1.lapl.org/pics18/00008563.jpg" title="betweenthecrest" target="_blank">the</a> <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/theAstoria" title="noAstorshere" target="_blank">Astoria</a>, the <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/HotelBelmont" title="yummy" target="_blank">YWCA</a> and of course perennial favorite <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/angelsflight" title="AutoFocus" target="_blank">Angels Flight</a>.  Note that what&#8217;s usually known as the <a href="http://jpg3.lapl.org/pics37/00068382.jpg" title="CCmusicfactory" target="_blank">Mission Apartments</a> over at Second and Olive is called the Castle Craig.</p>

<p>A couple more you should recognize above—<a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/TheZelda" title="zeldistic" target="_blank">Zelda</a> at Fourth and Grand, over her shoulder, the <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/touraine" title="tourained" target="_blank">Touraine</a>.</p>
<p>Of course no account of BH would be complete without an image of the Second/Hill area:</p>

<p>&#8230;covered of course to an absurd degree <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/TheDirtPatchofSecondandHill" title="goodtimes" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/HillStBlockRoundup" title="moreyet" target="_blank">here</a>.  In this depiction one gets a feeling for the majesty of the Hotel Locke, and of the ornate nature of those façades lopped off due to Second Street’s widening during construction of the tunnel (say goodbye to the <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/node/174" title="arrrgghhgyle" target="_blank">Argyle</a> turret!).</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/rose_mansion" title="RM" target="_blank">Rose Mansion</a> at the bottom corner of Fourth and Grand (closest to the Fr in Fremont).  Kitty-corner across from the Rose are the towers of the <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/Hershey_CastleTowers" title="CTscan" target="_blank">Hershey/Castle</a>; next to her, the magnificent <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/brunson_mansion" title="brunsonburner" target="_blank">Brunson Mansion</a>.  The Fleur de Lis you&#8217;ll remember as the blink-of-an-eye <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/bryan_mansion" title="BM" target="_blank">Bryan Mansion</a>. Upper right, looming large at Third and Bunker Hill Avenue is the <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/AsktheDust" title="AVklub" target="_blank">Alta Vista</a>; behind, on Flower, the <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/StRegis" title="SR" target="_blank">St. Regis</a>.</p>
<p>While we&#8217;re on the subject of Buker Hill Ave., let&#8217;s take a closer look-see:</p>

<p>&#8230;heading up the street we&#8217;ve got the <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/salt_box" title="SB" target="_blank">Salt Box</a>, <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/333_BunkerHill" title="666" target="_blank">333 South Bunker Hill</a>, the <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/castle" title="CastleII" target="_blank">Castle</a>, the <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/lady_mcdonald_residence" title="oldmcdonald" target="_blank">Lady McDonald</a>, and the distinctive tower of the <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/foss_heindel" title="FH" target="_blank">Foss/Heindel</a> all on the east side of the street.</p>

<p>A bit further north is Hill standout <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/theDome" title="domalicious" target="_blank">The Dome</a> (aka the <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/DomeWrapUp" title="minniewhonow" target="_blank">Minnewaska</a>) at Second and Grand; the Majestic, top, at First and Hope, later became the <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/MoreRossmere" title="rossswiss" target="_blank">Rossmere</a>; our turreted pal in the upper left is at <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/WalkerBunkerRanger" title="FirstFlowering" target="_blank">First and Flower</a>.</p>
<p>Bunker Hill north of First tends to get the short shrift around here.  (For that we apologize and look forward to remedying this injustice in the coming year.)  Not that we haven’t poked around up there a bit:</p>

<p>Here for example, center right, is the <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/st_angelo" title="theSA" target="_blank">St. Angelo</a>, up on <a href="http://jpg1.lapl.org/spnb01/00007332.jpg" title="laplangeload" target="_blank">North Grand</a>.  Lurking behind would be the <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/larronde" title="larrondey" target="_blank">Larronde</a> residence.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s just a taste of the Hill.  (Where, you ask, are the <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/burnmelroseburn" title="melroseplace" target="_blank">Melrose</a> and <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/fremont_2" title="freebird" target="_blank">Fremont</a>, to name but two?)  <i>And </i>the map stretches from West Lake Park to the river.  But don&#8217;t take my word for it.

<p>Now then.  Having applied quantum gravity to traversable wormhole metrics, and stuff, I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;ve constructed a time machine by affixing a Powerbook 180 to the Worthington Gates. </p>

<p>Corner of Fourth and Olive, August 29, 1962.</p>
<p>Van R. Alexanian, 23, was loading a barrel of rubbish into the scoop on the front of his trash-truck when the parking brake gave way.  The truck ran into an electrical pole, and the live wire caught the truck debris on fire.  The pole then fell onto a Mrs. Helen Stairs, 50.</p>
<p>The flaming truck went on to take out a traffic signal and a lamp post before crashing into a garage.  This much was fortunate; the garage attendant was equipped with a fire extinguisher.</p>

<p>
Officer L. S. Rasic commented that had the truck continued through the intersection, it would have crashed into eight cars waiting for the signal to change.</p>
<p>The question remains as to what garage the garbage truck plowed into, as there were in fact three at Olive and Fourth:  the 1923 Mutual Garage at the NE corner, the 1919 Hotel Clark/Center Garage at the SE corner, and the 1923 Savoy Garage at the SW corner.  Here&#8217;s a picture of all three, 1966:</p>

The 600-car Mutual at left in the image above is now the foundation for <a href="http://www.you-are-here.com/los_angeles/californiaplaza.html" title="CP2" target="_blank">Cal Plaza Two</a>.  The Hotel Clark Garage, center (along with that tall white building, ironically named the <a href="http://jpg1.lapl.org/pics26/00032547.jpg" title="larryjew" target="_blank">Black Building</a>) is still an empty lot, site of what was to be <a href="http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Confusion+greets+Three+Cal+Plaza+default+notice,+some+see+union+tie-a013927656" title="C3PO" target="_blank">Cal Plaza Three</a>.

		<p>May 6, 1915.  Mr. H. J. Robinson, of 210 South Flower, met long-time acquaintance Ernest Lightfoot at another house Robinson owned at 121 South Flower.  While the two were inspecting 121—Lightfoot had proposed Robinson trade him the house for some land in the Imperial Valley—Lightfoot slugged the elderly Robinson, knocking him unconscious.  </p>
<p>Robinson recovered consciousness enough to feel someone tugging at his diamond ring—which he’d never been able to get off himself, though Lightfoot was able to do enough of a number on Robinson’s finger to effect removal.</p>
<p>While Robinson recovered in Westlake Hospital, suffering contusions of the head and a concussion of the brain (and a bruised finger), Lightfoot was picked up by detectives.  Turns out this Lightfoot was the same charmer who in 1910 was charged with rape and given five years probation, and who in 1914 was arrested for child abandonment.</p>

<p>Yes, 210 South Flower, which we know as the Stanley Apartments, as pictured <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/node/157" title="youknowforrobbers" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/TheMarcella" title="andinthecomments" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

For the article they dug up one of the original uprooted persons, a Jim Dorr, 73, who’d been sent a notice by the CRA to vacate the Stanley Apartments on November 15, 1965.  He’s glad he saved those displacement papers all these years:  HUD will give him priority in the otherwise random lottery.</p>
<p>Sez Jim:</p>
<p>“I’ve been around Bunker Hill off and on now for forty or fifty years.  They say it was nice once.  But they let it run down for years.  The Stanley was a very old place, well kept, but they didn’t spend much money on it.”&#157;</p>
<p>(Just for the record, despite what it says in the caption at right, the Bunker Hill Towers are not on the spot of the Stanley.  The Stanley is at the red hatched box below; Dorr&#8217;s standing at the blue dot.)</p>

		<p>A glance at mid-century America reveals it emblazoned with the familiar totems:  military might, industrial supremacy, cultural imperialism.  These were carved by fervent if not blind <i>progress</i>, and you’d be given a funny look (if not worse) were you to dare question <i>that</i>.  </p>
<p>Nobody would dare bat an eye as freeways forever cut up cities, and huge swaths of our collective memory were lost to parking lots and well-intentioned developments.  Funny old buildings were the realm of <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/MunstersofBunkerHill" title="universalmutants" target="_blank">mutants</a>, after all.</p>
<p>But even in the glory days of unquestioned, unfettered forward movement—before, say, Dallas ’63 and Watts ’65—there was a small rumbling of (not unpatriotic) discontent.  Landmarks were lost hand over fist but when in 1962 it came time for <a href="http://www.nyc-architecture.com/GON/GON004.htm" title="6-5000" target="_blank">Penn Station</a> to become so much New Jersey Medowlands landfill, eyebrows were raised.  This was <i>Penn Station</i>, after all.  Somebody at <i>Life</i> magazine (somebody who ambled through Penn Station to the <i>Life</i> offices at Rockefeller Center, most likely) realized that losing our common heritage would make a nifty nine-page spread.  And so <i>Life</i> called upon heavyweight photojournalist <a href="http://www.getty.edu/art/gettyguide/artMakerDetails?maker=1634" title="WEsnapper" target="_blank">Walker Evans</a> to do the immortalizing.</p>
<p>Walker shot in New York, as well as Norwalk, Conn; Boston and Amesbury, Mass; then out to California for Nevada City, San Francisco, and, in October of 1962, Los Angeles.  Where he made a beeline to Bunker Hill.  He shot all over the Hill but curiously took his greatest number of shots of 101 South Flower, and it was 101 South Flower that made it into the magazine:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3229/3087581193_894f6b9af5_o.gif" alt="FirstFlowerLife" height="553" width="250"></p>
<p>What can be said of 101-109, aka 101-111 South Flower?  Precious little.  We know that it is announced in February of 1904, to run $16,000 ($364,809 USD 2007).</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3164/3087579775_8a94a883db_o.gif" alt="comingout" height="70" width="463"></p>
<p>But a thorough check of its various addresses shows that nothing of consequence ever there occurred.</p>

<p>The southwest corner of First and Flower:</p>

Marie heard Clifford was dead, and so she remarried, only Clifford wasn’t dead, just…disappeared.  To Bunker Hill.  She lived down on 37th Street; Bunker Hill may as well be the moon.  After six years of Clifford being “deceased”&#157; she caught wind that he wasn’t, had him tracked down, and he was popped at our First &amp; Flower apartment house in November 1925 on a deadbeat dad charge.  That’s about as racy as it gets; that, and the residents of this particular place had a terrible habit of stepping off of this curb and that into fatally well-built oncoming automobiles.</p>

<p>Fortunately what we lack in drama we make up for in image quantity.  It was captured of course by the incomparable Arnold Hylen:</p>

<p>Today, of course, the building is demolished, but one isn’t always expecting to find the same thing to have happened to the <i>street</i>.  Where has all the Flower gone?</p>
<p>In each of the two images below:  First at the top, Second at the bottom, Figueroa at the left (yes, I know Fig is a Street and not an Avenue, that’s Baists for you) Hope on the right.  In the top image, Flower runs down the middle, and there’s 101 in orange, with “Labarere Tr.”&#157; (for Labarere Tract) written across it.  In the modern image below, well Flower just went away.</p>

<p>In writing about the Amesbury, Mass. <a href="http://www.historicnewengland.org/visit/homes/rocky.htm" title="RHMH" target="_blank">Rocky Hill Meeting House</a> <i>Life</i> notes that a proposed expressway is taking down three 18th-century buildings and coming within yards of the structure, which is in a state of <a href="http://www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/collection_database/objectview_altviewenlarge.aspx?page=51&amp;sort=3&amp;sortdir=asc&amp;keyword=&amp;fp=51&amp;dd1=0&amp;dd2=0&amp;vw=1&amp;collID=0&amp;OID=190037903&amp;vT=1&amp;iID=15&amp;iPage=2" title="holyholy" target="_blank">miraculous state</a> of preservation.  This writer does not know if the 1963 worries about blasting and vibrations undermined the building, or played havoc with the 1780s glazing, but I do know that the 495 is now a stone’s throw away, and I call that wrong.  </p>

After a three-year battle, citizens saved the mansion by referendum; the city ignored this and set out to build the city hall on the mansion grounds <i>again</i>.

<p>And so while the vast majority of the subjects in <i>Life</i>’s article survived to see another millennium, 101 South Flower did not.  Nor did any of the any other structures shot by Evans that Los Angeles October.</p>

<p>Joe Chavez was busted down on Bunker Hill. ’Twas late in the Decembertime (the <i>holiday season</i>, for the Love of Mary), and Joe, 50, hungry, hunkered down in his pad at 221 South Bunker Hill, went and thought, <i>I’m going to go liberate a little something from a nearby market to ease my gnawing gut.  What’s the worst that could happen?</i></p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3008/3069206420_5c190a1324_o.gif" alt="hungrymandinner" height="123" width="503"></p>
<p>December 29, 1954.  Joe exits 221, heads down to a small grocery at 108 South Broadway.  Unfortunately for Joe, somebody called in his little lift, a 484, as a 64 (that’s a petty theft blossomed into an armed robbery to the KMA367).  So the coppers arrived a-blazing, but store owner Carl Johnson, 28, already had things handled.  Johnson, evidently an ex-footballer, hit Chavez—ham neatly tucked under one arm—with a flying tackle.  </p>
<p>Joe rang in the New Year at City Jail, after a trip to Georgia Street Receiving; his tackle resulted in a broken nose.</p>
<p>So what do we know of 221 South Bunker Hill?  That it appeared between the 1888 and 1894 Sanborn maps.  That it changed comparatively little between 1894 and 1955:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3181/3069206480_13182f260a_o.gif" alt="1894sbm" align="left" height="230" width="260"><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3165/3069206548_133ab8e16e_o.gif" alt="1955sbm" align="right" height="228" width="250"></p>

<p>221 was photographed as having a wall in front in the mid-1950s:</p>

<p>Which it lost in favor of this lacework-laden thicket theme:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3004/3068370423_e99f0fb7b4_o.gif" alt="tangle" align="middle" height="333" width="333"></p>

This is a shockingly New Orleans house in general.  Granted, the steep cross gables are more Gothic Revival than archetypal Crescent City, but this style of roof treatment is seen frequently in New Orleans.  The two-tiered porch with full-length windows are a Gulf Coast hallmark.  Doubly remarkable is that this house, with its gingerbread at the upper gallery, choice of board over shingle, and single light in the center gable—evocative of the Creole cottage—was constructed contemporary to New Orleans’s residential blanketing via the shotgun house (the four-bay arrangement of this home mirroring the double shotgun, though the door placement lends and air of the famous New Orleans centerhall villa).  Granted, it’s a little out of place <i>here</i>; those tall windows are intended to dispel mugginess, hardly a chief concern in the realm of Ask the Dust.  Nevertheless, this wasn’t a celebratory tribute to quaint olde New Orleans—it was built by and for Victorians.</p>
<p>Sad to think that as Disney was building his homage to all things bayou down in Anaheim, this little piece of oddball Angelenism was ground up for landfill.</p>

<p>Dodge City. Tombstone. The OK Corral.Â  Wyatt Earp will also be remembered as a guy who ran a piece of two-bit flimflam on Bunco Hill. And got popped for it—but then, this was no 1880s gambling saloon. This was the grandest new hotel in Taft-era Los Angeles. Perhaps Earp was a little out of his element.</p>
<p>After the turn of the century, Earp was based out of Los Angeles, trying his hand at the kind of gambling grown-ups do—oil exploration, mining ventures, real estate—with considerable less success than he’d had at the card table. Occasionally he’d work with LAPD on outside-jurisdiction work, like chasing fugitives into Mexico, but inveterate gambler Earp’s core motivation remained gambling. This would on occasion put lawman Earp on the wrong side of the straight and narrow—e.g., his refereeing of the Fitzsimmons-Sharkey boxing match of ’96, generally regarded to be fixed. And when Earp and his con-rades would set up their fleece outfit, where else would they go but that anchor of Bunker Hill, the brand-new Auditorium Hotel?</p>

<p>The Auditorium had been open a scant six months when on July 21, 1911, a J. Y. Peterson sat down for game of <a title="allsfaroincardsandwar" href="//www.lahacal.org/gentleman/faro.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">faro</a> with three sharpers from San Francisco—W. W. Stap, Waller Scott, and E. Dunn. But all would not go as planned.</p>
<p>Seems that Peterson—a real estate agent with an office at 407 Stimson Building—got hinkey at the trio’s far-out tale that they were sore at their SF syndicate, and wanted to stiff their own backers by rigging the game to let Peterson win big. Peterson would thus play the rigged game—pinpricked odd cards, the dealer placing a finger on the table when an even card was to show—in front of others, and make a hefty profit on the $2,500 ($54,985 USD2007) he’d invest at the outset in chips. Realizing he had nothing to lose except his roll, he called in the coppers.</p>
<p>Stap, Scott, and card-dealer Dunn engaged club rooms 425-426 at the Auditorium, installed their faro bank outfit and all kindred paraphernalia, and were ready to get down to the business of swindling Peterson—who was further tipped off to that fishy smell in Denmark as there were no other players present—when Johnny Law busted in.</p>
<p>Down at the station-house, the W. W. Stap who inveigled Peterson into buy into a fixed bank game turned out to be none other than Wyatt Earp. Released from City Jail on $500 bond, Earp’s explanation was that it was purely accidental that he should be there during the raid. The police, in their infinite wisdom, elected to bust into the room before any gambling actually begun, which sank the conspiracy to defraud charge; the courts couldn’t make a vagrancy charge stick, either.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-822" src="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/itJustHappenedBuncoExplanation-150x150.gif" alt="itJustHappenedBuncoExplanation" width="150" height="150">In the end, the City Prosecutor decided there wasn’t enough evidence against Earp. Waller Scott pleaded guilty and demanded a jury trial, but the City Prosecutor “didn’t have the time”&#157; to take it up and let the whole thing drop. Dunn, aka Harry Dean, pleaded guilty and was given a six month sentence, suspended, on condition that he leave the city. And so <a title="offyago" href="http://www.wyattsearp.com/history12.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wyatt Earp</a> went on his six-shooterin’ way: he hung around Hollywood and hit up William S. Hart to publicize his life. That never happened, ended up dying down on <a title="wipedawaybychildren" href="http://www.greatschools.net/school/rating.page?id=2258&amp;state=CA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">17th Street</a>, and was buried in a <a title="thatsfunnyhedoesntlookit" href="http://www.ajhs.org/publications/chapters/chapter.cfm?documentID=279" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jewish cemetery</a> in 1929.</p>
<p><em>Finest New Hotel in Modern Christendom</em></p>
<p>“It will command a view of perennial green, unsurpassed in the heart of any great city!”&#157;</p>
<p>What <em>was</em> this this hotbed of vice, the Auditorium Hotel? Only the finest new hotel in Christendom, mister. (“It will command a view of perennial green, unsurpassed in the heart of any great city!”&#157;)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/author/nathan/page/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/auditoriumHotel.gif"><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-834" src="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/author/nathan/page/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/auditoriumHotel-300x182.gif" alt="auditoriumHotel" width="300" height="182" srcset="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/auditoriumHotel-300x182.gif 300w, https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/auditoriumHotel-475x288.gif 475w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 85vw, 300px"></a></p>
<p>It all began with the northwest corner of Fifth and Olive, facing Central Park. (I know, the purist in you wants to object that we’re not technically <em>on</em> Bunker Hill. Well, think of the Auditorium Hotel as our landmark edge to the south. The Jaffa Gate, if you will. Angels Flight is the Dung Gate and we’ll call the <a title="Damascusgate" href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/author/nathan/page/TheMonarch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monarch Hotel</a> Damascus Gate while we’re at it. Naturally you’re continuing to argue that the Edison Building makes a better Jaffa Gate than the Auditorium Hotel. Well, you would say that.)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/author/nathan/page/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/auditoriumAddOn.gif"><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-832" src="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/author/nathan/page/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/auditoriumAddOn-300x154.gif" alt="auditoriumAddOn" width="300" height="154"></a></p>
<p>Auditorium architect Otto <a title="Keannu" href="http://flickr.com/photos/12576329@N04/1306901921/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neher</a>, with partner Chauncey Fitch <a title="madskillz" href="http://www.you-are-here.com/building/lincoln_heights.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Skilling</a>, produced the New Auditorium Hotel, designed in what the papers for lack of a better term called the “Modern Classic”&#157; style. It was 60&#215;162’, faced with light-colored granite, the lobbies lavished in marble, mahogany and mosaic tile. The six floors of 150 rooms are paneled in birch.<br>
<img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3041/3014282449_247b29640b_o.gif" alt="rendering" width="575" height="359"></p>
<p>A look up Olive—the three biggest buildings behind the Auditorium are the <a title="trenton" href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/author/nathan/page/hoteltrenton" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trenton</a>, the <a title="free" href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/author/nathan/page/fremont" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fremont</a>, and the Palace Hotel:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/author/nathan/page/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/viewUpOliveAuditorium.gif"><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-835" src="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/author/nathan/page/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/viewUpOliveAuditorium-300x266.gif" alt="viewUpOliveAuditorium" width="300" height="266" srcset="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/viewUpOliveAuditorium-300x266.gif 300w, https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/viewUpOliveAuditorium-475x422.gif 475w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 85vw, 300px"></a></p>
<p>The Auditorium is leased by Bernard Frank Green and his mother, Mrs. Mary Sells Green; in 1919 M. Drake Perry takes over the lease and buys the hotel from R. D. Wade in 1921. He puts in a grill room and makes another $100,000 in improvements. But the shock of the Biltmore Hotel being built on the opposite corner apparently killed Perry, and Probate Court sold the Auditorium Hotel to George Roos.</p>
<p>(The Biltmore to the left; the 1924 Pacific Telephone and Telegraph Company Mutual Exchange is under construction. The Deaconess/Clara Barton Hospital between the Methodist church and the new telephone building doesn&#8217;t have many days left before conversion to an auto park.)<img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-830" src="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/5thOliveRemodel-150x150.gif" alt="5thOliveRemodel" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/5thOliveRemodel-150x150.gif 150w, https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/5thOliveRemodel-160x160.gif 160w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 85vw, 150px"></p>
<p>Roos (vintage clothing collectors out there certainly know the Roos Bros. label—George was one of those Rooses) eventually sells to Charles Harris, who held the lease and ran the hotel through the 20s.</p>
<p>It’s an exciting time: everyone’s abuzz about the sale of the California Club at Fifth and Hill to the <a title="loftsforsalegetyourloftsforsale" href="http://titleguaranteebuilding.com/history.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Title Guarantee and Trust Company</a>, and the forthcoming home of <a title="nicemurals" href="http://www.glasssteelandstone.com/BuildingDetail/3611.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">California Edison</a> at Fifth and Grand. Harris refurnishes 100 rooms and renames the Auditorium the San Carlos in January 1929. Why? Because at that point he was spending most of his time in Phoenix, directing the opening of his mighty <a title="SC2" href="http://www.historichotels.org/hotel/Hotel_San_Carlos/629" target="_blank" rel="noopener">San Carlos there</a>. Just as there were once matching Auditoria, there were now Sister San Carloses. Charles Harris in 1931 departs the Phoenix San Carlos for yet his <a title="SC3" href="http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/tf8x0nb4gb/?docId=tf8x0nb4gb&amp;brand=calisphere&amp;layout=printable" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>third</em> San Carlos</a>, this one in <a title="nowfortheelderly" href="http://www.waymarking.com/gallery/image.aspx?f=1&amp;guid=e57de009-0f91-4658-838c-64cbc7c53790&amp;gid=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yuma</a>. He eventually sells his Los Angeles SC in toto to G. G. Joyce, owner of the Hazlewood restaurant chain in Portland.</p>

<p>Here, in this mid-30s image, check out the San Carlos neon blade affixed to the wedding cake that is the former Auditorium:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-837" src="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/author/nathan/page/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/sanCarlosSouth1930.gif" alt="sanCarlosSouth1930" width="379" height="514"></p>
<p>The San Carlos then went through a streamlining much in the way the Auditorium did:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-838" src="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/hazards1920.gif" alt="hazards1920" width="250" height="158"></p>

<p>Now we all know that the redoubtable Claud Beelman was the architect-at-helm for the 1938 Philharmonic Auditorium redesign. This author is yet to discover when (and by whom) the San Carlos had its cleanlining:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-841" title="" src="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/author/nathan/page/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/sanCarlosCleanedUp1940-300x250.gif" alt="sanCarlosCleanedUp1940" width="349" height="291" srcset="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/sanCarlosCleanedUp1940-300x250.gif 300w, https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/sanCarlosCleanedUp1940-475x396.gif 475w" sizes="(max-width: 349px) 85vw, 349px"></p>
<p>The San Carlos made its way into the Modern Age, even acquiring a 1955 <a title="A&amp;D" href="http://www.laokay.com/ArmetDavisNewlove.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Armet and Davis</a> Googies:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-842" title="" src="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/author/nathan/page/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/sanCarlosGoogie-300x204.gif" alt="sanCarlosGoogie" width="362" height="246" srcset="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/sanCarlosGoogie-300x204.gif 300w, https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/sanCarlosGoogie-475x323.gif 475w" sizes="(max-width: 362px) 85vw, 362px"></p>
<p>…so what became of our Jaffa Gate? Unlike most of Bunker Hill, it made it all the way through the mid-1980s. Here, you could hang at Googies and get a room at the Carlos to boot, ca. 1986; that’s the <a title="BMTower" href="http://www.you-are-here.com/los_angeles/biltmore.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biltmore Tower</a> going up in the background:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-843" title="" src="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/author/nathan/page/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/sanCarlosGoogieAlt-300x226.gif" alt="sanCarlosGoogieAlt" width="371" height="279" srcset="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/sanCarlosGoogieAlt-300x226.gif 300w, https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/sanCarlosGoogieAlt-475x358.gif 475w" sizes="(max-width: 371px) 85vw, 371px"></p>
<p>(But first, a map, so as to explicate the many addresses of the Auditorium/San Carlos.)</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-845" title="" src="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/author/nathan/page/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/baistMapSanCarlos-300x214.gif" alt="baistMapSanCarlos" width="300" height="214" srcset="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/baistMapSanCarlos-300x214.gif 300w, https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/baistMapSanCarlos-475x340.gif 475w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 85vw, 300px"></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-846" src="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/author/nathan/page/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bookieRaids.gif" alt="bookieRaids" width="200" height="196">William Friedland was a cigar store clerk at one of the San Carlos’s sidewalk shops. At least he was until February of 1939, when he got popped for making book therein. The establishment at 513 West Fifth had been raided many times for horserace betting, and in November 1940 Friedland had to go before the LA County Grand Jury to dish the dirt on a crooked horserace racket. He was grilled by none other than Jerry Gielsler, chairman of the Horse Racing Board, who disclosed the racing scandal. Swirled into the mix of our tobaccoshop/bookstore at the San Carlos were bribe-taking jockeys and horse owners, as well as local sharpies Benny Chapman, I. W. Kivel, aka Doc Kebo; Bernard Einstoss, alias Barney Mooney; and Saul “Sonny”&#157; Greenberg. Mooney and Kebo gave horse owner Irving Sangbusch (alias James J. Murphy) over $20,000 to bribe jockeys at Hollywood Park in 1939; by the end of 1940 the take was up to $180,000 on a single race.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-847" src="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/author/nathan/page/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/witnessWilliam-300x269.gif" alt="witnessWilliam" width="300" height="269"></p>

He asserted that the clicking of chips and rattle of dice could be heard from 511 West Fifth as early as 1925 (he remembered the date because that was about the time habitué-of-the-place Eddie Eagen was shot there in a holdup). Selby said that when 513 was in operation, he could hear loud-speakers announcing race results in the garage. When asked if it was loud enough for a policeman on the street to hear it: “Oh,”&#157; said Selby, “they all knew about it.”&#157;</p>

<p>Things got even saucier when the horse trainer for <a title="downargentineweigh" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLM9s_02F9s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Don Ameche</a> and <a title="Lum" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyueF97LN6w&amp;feature=related" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chester &#8220;Lum&#8221; Lauck</a> testified that he was approached by Bernard Mooney, and that Mooney wanted to fix Ameche’s horses to lose races. Apparently Mooney enlisted his pal <a title="GR" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWdX0S2OoZg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">George Raft</a> to have a friendly discussion with Ameche about the subject.</p>
<p>Of five defendants, only Bernard Mooney got nicked—for contributing the delinquency of minors. Minor jockeys, which legally should cancel itself out. Some $1,000 fines were assessed, but then, that’s what these fellows spent on shoes in a month. Sure, the Black Socks made finageling baseball illegal, but what was so wrong with a little racetrack gratuity? Giesler went all nuts afterward and called for laws protecting boxing, football, wrestling&#8230;wrestling has, for example, been unhindered by money and scripting ever since.

<p>Let’s stay on the subject of crime.</p>
<p>The Auditorium wasn’t open six months before the help developed sticky fingers; in July 1911 bellboy Raymond Perry was nabbed in his hotel down on Grand between 5th and 6th, secreting stolen diamonds in his socks.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-853" src="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/author/nathan/page/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/stockInSock-150x150.gif" alt="stockInSock" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/stockInSock-150x150.gif 150w, https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/stockInSock-160x160.gif 160w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 85vw, 150px"></p>
<p>In 1919 Harry Royse decided to give up the life of a minister. The life of a Methodist clergyman—which he’d led for ten years—lost its kick apparently, so he spent most of that ’19 checking into hotels and burglarizing the stores therein, and sending ill-gotten gains to his new lady-friend up in San Francisco.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-854" src="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/author/nathan/page/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/preacher.gif" alt="preacher" width="277" height="291"></p>
<p>Royse was finally nabbed in the act with his fifteen-year-old nephew in tow, pilfering typewriters from the Auditorium’s shop on the corner of Fifth and Olive. He was given one to fourteen at Q; the nephew went to juvenile hall, and the gal up north got no more pretty things.</p>

<p>The early morning of Dec 21, 1924 saw a the arrival of the “variety bandits.”&#157; Two men hit the Moon Drug Store at 3526 West Washington, forcing the soda clerk into the closet and making off with $200; they hit the Barnett Drug Store at 3723 South Vermont, where they locked up two women and emptied the register of $75 (during which time a customer entered; one of the bandits took off his cap and waited on the gent, selling him a magazine and pocketing the proceeds); they hit the Zenith Drug Store at 4929 Moneta, and made off with $60; and when they then hit Harry Spooner’s drug store at 4493 Beverly Blvd, they got $30 and eight pints of whiskey. Maybe it was the whiskey. Maybe it was getting late. Maybe it was just time for their luck to change. Because things didn’t go so well at the Auditorium Hotel.</p>
<p>Just before dawn, these two heavily armed gents muscled night clerk J. C. Evans into the back to open the safe. Though threatened with instant death, Evans claimed he didn’t have the combination. As the two holdup men argued, Evans slipped away, and the bandits took right after him. Unfortunately for them, Evans had a good knowledge of the many doorways and halls of the lower floor, and got a good lead on them, long enough to turn, produce his own hand cannon, and open fire. The robbers, one of them apparently hit, had to make it out of the hotel in a mad dash and into their touring car and speed away into the first morning light, never to be heard from again.</p>

<p>August 14, 1927 was a red-letter day for crime in Los Angeles: armed men stole $2,000 in cash and jewelry, and a $1,500 car, from a auto dealership at 1355 South Main; two men were beaten and robbed by a gang of thugs at West Tenth St. near Georgia; two men in an automobile drove up alongside—a reverend, no less—Rev. Joseph Curran at Eightieth and Moneta, and robbed him without even getting out of their car.</p>

<p>Lastly, later that night, three gunmen showed up at the auto rental concern in the Auditorium Hotel to relieve manager D. C. Huff of $85 ($1,007 USD2007).</p>
<p>Reprobate gaming came back into fashion at the San Carlos in 1948…in the form of pinball. In March of 1948 nine men were arrested by the administrative vice squad for owning these marble contraptions, in flagrant violation of the City’s antipinball ordinance. Asst. City Atty. Donald Redwine, however, doubts the arrests should have been made until someone comes up with a “clear-cut decision”&#157; on the legality of these newfangled games. Of course, <a title="pinhist" href="http://marvin3m.com/gtb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pinball</a> isn’t exactly <em>new</em>, but if there’s one thing 1947 gave us it’s a pinball machine that (distributors claim) is a <a title="histoierpinball" href="http://www.bmigaming.com/pinballhistory.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“game of science and skill.”&#157;</a> That notwithstanding, one LaVerne Murphy is cooling his heels in the tank after vice squad raiders came down on his newfangled “flippered”&#157; machine in the San Carlos. (Even if they are just games of “science and skill,”&#157; you still can’t own one without a permit.)</p>

<p>Let’s move on from crime to death and despair!</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-863" src="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/author/nathan/page/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/carbolicAcid.gif" alt="carbolicAcid" width="293" height="261">In June of 1914, Mrs. H. G. Purcell, 50, a woman of wealth and taste, had come from Chicago to buy a lot and build a home in sunny Los Angeles. For two years she lived in the Auditorium Hotel, well-liked and highly sought after for social and cultural gatherings. And yet, her father having died of cancer, she believed, rightly or wrongly, that it was going to get her too, and drank a phial of carbolic acid in her room.</p>
<p>February 1940, insurance man Jesse Edward Patty, 47, left his home at 1227 S. Plymouth Blvd. and checked into the San Carlos with murderous intent. Self-murderous. Several letters to his wife and friends later, he took poison. <img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-866" src="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/author/nathan/page/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/insuranceSalesman.gif" alt="insuranceSalesman" width="278" height="110"></p>
<p>L. D. Roberts, a 50-year-old lumber man, left his home at 7024 Mission Place in Huntington Park, July 1942, to check into the San Carlos. Roberts had problems, but brought with him a traditional problem-solver, the .32 automatic.<img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-867" src="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/lumber.gif" alt="lumber" width="256" height="85"></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-868" src="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/manWife.gif" alt="manWife" width="232" height="204">Joe Guiterrez, 45, lived at the San Carlos. He’d been separated from his wife Rafaela Uriarte Guiterrez, 46, for two years. It was Sept. 3, 1941, and Joe had had enough of the San Carlos. He wanted to come home to their house at 1314 Sunset Blvd. He wanted a reconciliation. Always bring a gun to a reconciliation.</p>
<p>Rafaela’s kids from a previous marriage were home—Rosie, 24, Lydia, 20, Mario, 16, and Carmen Uriarte, 14. Mom and “dad”&#157; hadn’t been talking long when they heard the shot. Joe came out firing, the girls fled, Carmen took one through the knee and Lydia through the shoulder before Joe was tackled by Mario. Gutierrez shoved the gun into Mario’s side and pulled the trigger, but the gun was empty. Mario kicked dad out the back door. Gutierrez reloaded his .25, and gave himself the same treatment he gave mom: one to the head.</p>
<p>And lest we forget “Miss Dale Erwin, 22, of Trenton, NJ”&#157; who checked into the San Carlos in August of 1946 and promptly leapt—or fell—from her window. As she landed in a second-floor courtyard, and there were plenty of taller hotels around, let’s give her the benefit of the doubt.<img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-865" src="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/fifthFlorr.gif" alt="fifthFlorr" width="242" height="58"></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-864" title="" src="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/author/nathan/page/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/establishingShot1-196x300.gif" alt="establishingShot" width="196" height="300">Let’s go back in time a bit and take a look at some of the folks who make the Auditorium so <em>special</em>.</p>
<p>One is Frederick Jordan, vice-president of the Entomological Society of England. The esteemed zoologist, whose soul is one with butterflies and moths and whose body is dedicated to the netting of terebrant hymenopterae—those that fly, of course—is a welcome additon to the Auditorium. But not as a guest. He’s the night porter<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-877" title="" src="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/author/nathan/page/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bushel.gif" alt="bushel" width="255" height="245">.</p>
<p>Seems his English doctor told him to get some sun, and not work too hard. Despite the lateness of the season—October, 1911—Jordan found Los Angeles choked with butterflies, especially the Spring Beauty, the Holly Blue, the Zebra Swallowtail, the Checkered Skipper, the Brown Argus, the Clifden Nonpareil, the Tortoiseshell, the Mother Shipton and the Duke of Burgundy Fritillary. That’s great Jordan, now get back to work.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-888" src="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/author/nathan/page/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/oldFriends.gif" alt="oldFriends" width="250" height="235">In the vein of any grand hotel (or, say, <a title="GH" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Ed8WddJ1g" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Grand Hotel</em></a>), the Auditorium lobby was always full of great excitement, chance meetings, tearful partings, tearful reunions. Such was the case when Dr. D. A. Gildersleeve of Richmond was in town for a 1911 AMA conference to deliver the stirring paper “Hook-worm and What Has Been Done In the South Toward Its Eradication”&#157; when he was approached by none other than “Uncle Joe,”&#157; who had been residing on East Ninth St. for some years. Joe, it seems, had been a Gilderslave, childhood playmate of the good doctor’s, had been Gildersleeve’s servant in battle in all the campaigns of Lee, but had ended up “disenfranchised”&#157; after The War. Joe stayed with Gildersleeve for some years but eventually went up North; and now, some thirty-five years later, they were reunited by chance in the Auditorium. An hour of gossip followed between the two in the big chairs; when the doctor bade the older man farewell he was observed slipping him what appeared to be a roll of banknotes. In describing the meeting, the Times writer showed his considerable cultural acuity—or vacuity of cultural sensitivity—in any event, I’m not going to transcribe it, but will here attach a clip of the encounter between what the Times describes as the “shambling darky”&#157; and what I imagine as a <a title="KFCracker" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwURoueDzFo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Harland Sanders</a>/<a title="mustardy" href="http://www.mauricesbbq.com/ourbbq.cfm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maurice</a> <a title="statesrights" href="http://southernpartysw.tripod.com/southernpartiesofthesouthwestssecondsite/id31.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bessinger</a>-looking <a title="starsandbarsbabes" href="http://feministlawprofs.law.sc.edu/?p=3831" target="_blank" rel="noopener">old</a> <a title="defendothegreat" href="http://www.amazon.com/Defending-My-Heritage-Maurice-Bessinger/dp/0971336903" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ofay</a>:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-889" src="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/author/nathan/page/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/reunion-284x300.gif" alt="reunion" width="284" height="300"></p>
<p>Yep, that’s what it says.</p>
<p>Not all sightings at the Auditorium are happy ones. Leo Julofsky was a messenger for E. D. Levinson &amp; Co., 52 Broadway, New York. He was walking down the street one day—September 19, 1919—with another messenger and $330,000 in Liberty bonds. On their way to Mabon &amp; Co., 45 Wall St., Julofsky handed his satchel over to the other messenger to go in and wash his hands at 71 Broadway. The other messenger waited…and waited…and opened the satchel. It was empty. Julofsky, and $141,000 ($1,676,761 USD2007) were gone.<img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-887" src="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/author/nathan/page/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/nabbed-300x141.gif" alt="nabbed" width="300" height="141"></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-884" src="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/author/nathan/page/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/julosky-150x300.gif" alt="julosky" width="150" height="300">Julofsky rented an apartement on East 38th, just off Madison Ave. for a month, and then headed west. He met an ex-policeman named John J. Stoney in a Detroit YMCA and they began to travel together. (In answer to a question about girls, he was adamant that no girls were mixed up in the plot whatsoever. Make of that what you will.) Julofsky and Stoney were shacked up together at the Auditorium when Julofsky was nabbed in the lobby on December 27. “I don’t know why I did it,”&#157; said the son of a retired cloak and suit maker, “no girls were mixed up in it and no one is to blame but myself.”&#157; He was given three years and change in Sing Sing. He won’t be alone, though, as his brother Milton and a bond dealer from the Bronx named Arthur Miller were also sent up for criminally receiving his bonds.</p>
<h3>The Lobby of Convergence:</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-886" title="" src="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/author/nathan/page/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/lobby-300x192.gif" alt="lobby" width="416" height="266" srcset="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/lobby-300x192.gif 300w, https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/lobby-475x304.gif 475w" sizes="(max-width: 416px) 85vw, 416px"></p>
<p>The Auditorium Hotel features itself in a roundabout way as a minor footnote in the famous 1922 Klan raid of Volstead-violating Mexicans in Inglewood, wherein a police shootout ended up in the cops shooting—guess what!—three of their own, one fatally (the town constable), discovered only when the hoods were opened.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-885" src="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/author/nathan/page/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/keagle-300x131.gif" alt="keagle" width="300" height="131">In the depths of the lengthy trial, a stylishly dressed woman began to moan loudly, and when the bailiffs attempted to escort her out, she twisted and fought and screamed “Help! Help! Help! Let me go, I want to see a Kleagle, I want to see a <a title="fromtheKlavern" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleagle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kleagle</a>!”&#157; in tones so loud it brought people out from several floors above and below. She was carried out fighting and taken to the psychopathic ward for observation. Found in her handbag? Her Auditorium Hotel room key. (FYI, the Kleagle there at the time was Nathan A. Baker, then a deputy sheriff for Los Angeles County.)<img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-882" src="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/author/nathan/page/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/feegle.gif" alt="feegle" width="250" height="236"></p>
<p>And for the last time, that’s <em>Kleagle</em>, not <em>Fleegle</em>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-881" src="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/author/nathan/page/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/fairyTale.gif" alt="fairyTale" width="222" height="182">February 7, 1923. P. C. Steckel, a boilermaker, and prominent in organized-labor society, was in court today, telling the judge a tearful story all about how he’d been awarded the Carnegie medal of honor for rescuing some child from an oncoming train. The judge took this in, told Steckel that <a title="ArabianLabor" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheherazade" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scheherazade</a> had nothing on him, but that it had precious little to do with violating the Miller-Jones narcotic law. Seems Steckel sold four ounces of morphine to a narcotics enforcement officer at the Auditorium Hotel. Nevertheless, Judge Bledsoe said that Steckel was due some consideration for possession of the medal, and gave him only two years at <a title="FedPen" href="http://www.doc.wa.gov/facilities/mcneilhistory.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McNeill Island</a> instead of the customary four.</p>
<p>Then there was the matter of Charles Harris, whom you remember as owner-operator of the Auditorium in the 20s and orchestrated its change into the San Carlos, tossing Rev. George Chalmers Richmond out on his ear. Harris entered Richmond’s chamber on January 3, 1923, removed the pastor’s clothes and by force of threats kept him from his room. Richmond alleged his good reputation had been damaged and sued for $15,000. We don’t know what raised Harris’s ire, though we can speculate: <a title="RevGCR" href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,738388,00.html?iid=digg_share" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Richmond</a> was a defrocked Episcopal rector, Bolsheviki refusenik and IWW nogoodnik, and mortal enemy of Methodist <a title="FBS" href="http://www.1947project.com/roundup" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Fighting Bob”&#157; Shuler</a>. The Auditorium did have Methodists as neighbors, after all. (Why then he elected to rename the place San Carlos, which would vaguely reference some guy named Charles canonized by Papists, is beyond me.)<img loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-891" src="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/author/nathan/page/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/sues-300x74.gif" alt="sues" width="300" height="74"></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-880" src="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/author/nathan/page/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/decipher-300x65.gif" alt="decipher" width="300" height="65">The Auditorium was also an exhibition hall, of sorts. It was where you’d go in 1925 if you wanted to see, on display, <a title="biggerthanaringunfortunately" href="http://www.google.com/patents?id=2DhjAAAAEBAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=%22frank+prevost%22+1570178&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=0_1#PPA1,M1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Frank Prevost’s decoding machine</a>. Weighing only half a pound, but with a limitless capacity for sending mechanically coded messages, it represents twelve years of study and effort. See it at the Auditorium before it’s snapped up forever by the War Department!</p>
<p>Also, go visit <a title="bigbill" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_G._Bonelli" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bill Bonelli</a> at his (1932) HQ in the San Carlos, where he’ll enlist you in his cause against snooperism:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-876" src="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/author/nathan/page/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bonelli-300x255.gif" alt="bonelli" width="300" height="255"></p>
<p>So what became of this wonderland of wonders, you ask?</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-883" title="" src="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/googie-300x255.gif" alt="googie" width="386" height="328" srcset="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/googie-300x255.gif 300w, https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/googie-475x403.gif 475w" sizes="(max-width: 386px) 85vw, 386px"></p>
<p>The San Carlos crept her way into the Future, turning her back on the demolition of Bunker Hill behind.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-890" title="" src="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/sanCarlosGoodbye-300x238.gif" alt="sanCarlosGoodbye" width="379" height="301" srcset="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/sanCarlosGoodbye-300x238.gif 300w, https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/sanCarlosGoodbye-475x377.gif 475w" sizes="(max-width: 379px) 85vw, 379px"></p>
<p>Then, in 1983, David Houck, president of Auditorium Management Co., which purchased the Philharmonic from Temple Baptist, announced demolition to make way for a new office building, hotel and residential condominiums. (Interesting management style, and it remains a parking lot.) Physicians Pharmacy, which opened in the Auditorium Office Bldng. in 1906, moved its vast pharmacy museum—endless Edwardian prescription books, grinders and corkers, bottles full of arcane lotions and potions—across Olive to the San Carlos. That was a bad move: the San Carlos’s days were numbered.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-873" src="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/1987PreDemo-300x231.gif" alt="1987PreDemo" width="300" height="231" srcset="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/1987PreDemo-300x231.gif 300w, https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/1987PreDemo-475x366.gif 475w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 85vw, 300px"></p>
<p>What’s there to tell? Somewhere around 1987 the corner was cleared. Not a word in the papers to mark its passing. Nobody cried for First German Methodist, either.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-872" src="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/1987demo-300x201.gif" alt="1987demo" width="300" height="201" srcset="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/1987demo-300x201.gif 300w, https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/1987demo-475x319.gif 475w, https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/1987demo-272x182.gif 272w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 85vw, 300px"></p>
<p>The Southern California Gas Company thought their headquarters would be nifty there.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-874" src="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/1991-190x300.gif" alt="1991" width="190" height="300"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-875" src="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/1991FInish-232x300.gif" alt="1991FInish" width="232" height="300"></p>
<p>Richard Keating of Skidmore, Owings and Merrill thought it would be cool to design the top to look like a blue flame. Which it sort of does. At least you can eat at their Blue Flame cafeteria.</p>

<p>Why its crown does not light up blue at night is a mystery to all.</p>
<p>In any event, it is finished in 1991.</p>

<p>That then is the tale of the Auditorium/San Carlos Hotel.</p>
<p>Walk in the Gas Co. tower sometime and ask for the Wyatt Earp suite, you&#8217;re late for the faro game.</p>
