					<description><![CDATA[I was at the Central Library yesterday and was able to view Baist&#039;s Real Estate Survey of Los Angeles (1921) in person in the History Department on the lower level. It&#039;s such a great experience to be able to hold history in your hands and imagine youself visiting any of the old places in downtown Los Angeles. I recommend not only going to view the new exhibit &#034;LA Unfolded&#034; on October 15th, but also viewing and touching one of the original map books.(The librarian was very courteous and let me take digital photos of any plates that I wanted).
