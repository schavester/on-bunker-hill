					<description><![CDATA[I was 9 years old when the Zelda was torn down as part of the 4th Street Cut.  In those days I spent a lot of time walking around Bunker Hill.  One Saturday when the Zelda had been abandoned during the demolition and looked like it does in these pictures, I was curious and went poking around the building. It is amazing to me now that there was no one to see to it that a 9 year old couldn&#039;t get into the site.  I am ashamed now to say that I threw rocks through a couple of windows.  I do remember feeling saddness at losing this part of the Hill.  Just a foretaste of what was to come.

See the Mission-style white building, upper left?  That&#039;s the Granada.  Zelda was her neighbor.  Behind that date palm there.  
&lt;/p&gt;

Notice the lonely steps at the bottom of this image.  Those of course led one once through the doors of the &lt;a href=&quot;/node/183&quot; title=&quot;FremontPost&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Fremont&lt;/a&gt;.

					<description><![CDATA[OBH reader Carol kindly pointed out to us that Edith Claire Posener, aka Edith Spare (who in 1923 was to become Edith Head) moved into the Zelda ca. 1914.  Seems her fatherâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s work as a mining engineer took the family from their New York comforts to rough Mexican camp-towns where Edith and mother Anna would cook for the minersâ€”until  at last mama said enough is enough, packed up Edith and they moved in with mama&#039;s friend Mittie Morgan, who lived at the Zelda.  According to David Chierichettiâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s book on Head, there was a ballroom on the fourth floor of the Zelda and after Edith enrolled in Los Angeles High School (then at the corner of Sunset and Grand) she invited the school over to use it for a dance.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Edith graduated in 1917 and enrolled in Berkeley; when she returned to Los Angeles in 1920, she moved back in with Mittie who had built a home in the Westlake District. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Some might challenge my (granted, seemingly fatuous) remark about the Zelda being a restricted establishment in that Edith was the issue of Anna Levy and Max Posener; but remember, after Anna married Frank Spare, Edith at an early age took on her adopted Catholicism with vigor.&lt;br /&gt;
