					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.onbunkerhill.org/castle/#comment-341&quot;&gt;JimDawson&lt;/a&gt;.

My family owned The Castle for 30 years until the CRA took it over in the late 1960&#039;s.  I remember the filming of Kiss Me Deadly.  I remember thinking at the time that it was really something to have our property shown in a movie.  They even used the correct address, 325 S. Bunker Hill Avenue.  Little did I know that all these years later this would be all we have left besides our memories.  The Castle was beautifully shown in its brief appearance, especially the stained glass front doors.  Too bad it was in black and white because they were even more beautiful in color (see Leo Politi&#039;s book for a hint of what they were like in color).  The interior scenes of the entry hallway and the stairs were shot in The Castle.  However, what was purported to be Chrisina&#039;s appartment upstairs I don&#039;t think was shot in The Castle. I don&#039;t know where it was shot.

					<description><![CDATA[In the classic 1955 noir &lt;em&gt;Kiss Me Deadly&lt;/em&gt;,Â The Castle stood in for the boarding house residence of Christina Bailey (Cloris Leachman), whose violent death early in the film launched detective Mike Hammer (Ralph Meeker) on a search through Los Angeles to find her killers. A night exterior scene shows the front of the house lit up and still inÂ impressive shape; there were also interior scenes in the hallway, on the stairs, and in one of the upstairs rooms.

&lt;i&gt;When the CRA started ripping up the history of Los Angeles, I

being carted off, I guess in 1968.Â &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
Much of my interest was in recording the remaining artifacts of
the Pacific Electric Railway.Â  Even though most of the tracks and
right-of-ways had been destroyed, I managed to get there in time to
preserve many details that have since been obliterated.Â  I have
pictures of the destruction of the subway tunnel, shots of the tracks
at Gardiner Junction, the facilities at Sherman as well as interior
shots of the Subway Terminal Building.Â Â  I became interested in how
General Motors and Standard Oil sabotaged rail service, and researched
186 F2d 562, 1949, wherein the defendants were found guilty of
&#034;criminal conspiracy to monopolize ground transportation.&#034;&lt;/i&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[my name is jean karwelis, though im 47 years old i can remember going in the castle one time as a child. the experence has left its mark on me. when my father passed away 5 years ago i found a picture of he and i on the front porch. this was in 1968. when i found the picture memories came flooding back about that one day on the hill. i had to ask my mother &#034;where was this taken&#034; she said it was bunker hill. and that this house and one other had been saved. will i went on the hunt to find the castle, i needed to see it in person again. within short order i find where it had been moved, and i jump in my ruck and race to los anglels. to my suprise and horror, i find that im 30+ years late and it had burned down. the museum staff was really good to me. they took me to see the handful of artifacts that were left, and asked more questions than i could answer about the home. but this adventure has led me to learn everthng i could about bunker hill, and i have amassed a collection of photos 10,000+ of the buildings and life on the hill.
