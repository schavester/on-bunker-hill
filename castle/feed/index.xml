					<description><![CDATA[Hello, I grew up in Los Angeles and my sister and brotherâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s used to play in Bunker Hill. Â I remember these houses like it was yesterday! Â We never vandalized them or anything like that!! Â We always showed respect for the Beautiful homes they were... and one day they were gone  and we were so disappointed...And learning now, that they were Burnt up, just breaks my heart... I was born in 1949 and we were so poor, all we could afford was a two room tenement slum apartment for 7 of us. Â So I sure believed in the Magic Castle and that someday it would help me get out of the dump I was living in, and find my dream life with a beautiful home... Â I never found it... I found Jesus Christ and ever since I realized I am richer than any person!! Â Thank You for Sharing your pictures and for taking me back to my childhood !!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/castle/#comment-341&quot;&gt;JimDawson&lt;/a&gt;.

My family owned The Castle for 30 years until the CRA took it over in the late 1960&#039;s.  I remember the filming of Kiss Me Deadly.  I remember thinking at the time that it was really something to have our property shown in a movie.  They even used the correct address, 325 S. Bunker Hill Avenue.  Little did I know that all these years later this would be all we have left besides our memories.  The Castle was beautifully shown in its brief appearance, especially the stained glass front doors.  Too bad it was in black and white because they were even more beautiful in color (see Leo Politi&#039;s book for a hint of what they were like in color).  The interior scenes of the entry hallway and the stairs were shot in The Castle.  However, what was purported to be Chrisina&#039;s appartment upstairs I don&#039;t think was shot in The Castle. I don&#039;t know where it was shot.

					<description><![CDATA[In the classic 1955 noir &lt;em&gt;Kiss Me Deadly&lt;/em&gt;,Â The Castle stood in for the boarding house residence of Christina Bailey (Cloris Leachman), whose violent death early in the film launched detective Mike Hammer (Ralph Meeker) on a search through Los Angeles to find her killers. A night exterior scene shows the front of the house lit up and still inÂ impressive shape; there were also interior scenes in the hallway, on the stairs, and in one of the upstairs rooms.

&lt;i&gt;When the CRA started ripping up the history of Los Angeles, I
grabbed my camera and headed for the spots where they planned to wipe
out the most memories.Â  I got to Bunker Hill when the last homes were
being carted off, I guess in 1968.Â &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
Much of my interest was in recording the remaining artifacts of
the Pacific Electric Railway.Â  Even though most of the tracks and
right-of-ways had been destroyed, I managed to get there in time to
preserve many details that have since been obliterated.Â  I have
pictures of the destruction of the subway tunnel, shots of the tracks
at Gardiner Junction, the facilities at Sherman as well as interior
shots of the Subway Terminal Building.Â Â  I became interested in how
General Motors and Standard Oil sabotaged rail service, and researched
186 F2d 562, 1949, wherein the defendants were found guilty of
&#034;criminal conspiracy to monopolize ground transportation.&#034;&lt;/i&gt;
