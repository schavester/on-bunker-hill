					<description><![CDATA[Hi there, - Congratulations on your thorough research! I believe we have a Dodd and Williams office building in Long Beach, commissioned by the National Cash Register Co. It is being restored and repurposed for an Art Exchange. Unusual windows, probably plastered over in the 1930s, hint of a Beaux Art or maybe even Spanish facade. Check the SWB&#038;C Oct 24, 1924, in Long Beach Notes. Any additional details you might have will be really appreciated by the non-profit that is restoring the building. I take it D&#038;W did not leave an archive, residing nicely at UCSB?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/architectsbuilding/#comment-110&quot;&gt;nathan&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;
Scroll up there to 1924 to the bit about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thewillowspalmsprings.com/historical.html&quot; title=&quot;willowshistorical&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Willows&lt;/a&gt;.Â  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Truth is, the image I&#039;ve included is not an image of the Willows proper, but of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thewillowspalmsprings.com/odonnell_photos.html&quot; title=&quot;ODhouse&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;O&#039;Donnell house&lt;/a&gt;, built for &lt;a href=&quot;http://books.google.com/books?id=O9gBAAAAMAAJ&#038;pg=PA500&#038;dq=o%27donnell,+thomas+arthur+doheny&quot; title=&quot;OD&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Thomas O&#039;Donnell&lt;/a&gt;.Â  The official historic designation indicates its architect as William Charles Tanner.Â  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The Willows itself, while a Dodd and Richards, was &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; built for Untermyer--he bought it a year or two afterward.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Or so says Tony, a contributor from Desert Hot Springs. Â  Now Tony, to whom I owe the greatest of debts for having pointed these facts out to me, also notes that there exists no actual documentation indicating that neither Dodd nor Tanner had a hand in either structure:Â  the attributions have been passed down as word-of-mouth.Â  The nascent theory, still in development, is that Tanner, who was more artist than architect, went to work on the O&#039;Donnell and Dodd was brought in to flush things out.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
O&#039;Donnell was a king among California crude producers.Â  Not sure if he was an Uplifter, but Harry Marston Haldeman, president of LA&#039;s Pacific Pipe and Supply and rabid antiCommunist, was a founding Uplifter in 1913.Â  Haldeman was also part of an investment pool that bought into Julian Pete petroleum stock in 1925, a Ponzi scheme so odious that it led to the creation of the SEC (fat lot of good that did).Â  Cecil B. DeMille was also part of the &#034;Million Dollar&#034; cabal, indicted for embezzlement and usury, and he lived up the road from Dodd.Â  Dodd, upperworld as underworld, Uplifters, famous neighbors and usurious hydrocarbon stock schemes, all woven together...somehow.Â  There&#039;s and Ellroy novel in here. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
By the tent peg of Jael!Â  Wowza!Â  Christopher White of the University at Louisville--the gent who hipped me to the February 1927 reference to Riis Development in the &lt;i&gt;Times&lt;/i&gt;--sends in this:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3314/3440492452_2d7e3aa3fb_o.gif&quot; alt=&quot;riis1927&quot; height=&quot;397&quot; width=&quot;435&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3402/3439729447_4fc28dac05_o.gif&quot; alt=&quot;riisnow&quot; height=&quot;444&quot; width=&quot;435&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Like their George Washington at Denker &#038; 108th, here&#039;s another D&#038;R school that&#039;s lost its tower. Â 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Note how they&#039;ve sort of &#034;hollowed out&#034; the tower portion, completely eliminating the Romanesque arches.Â  I&#039;m having visions of colorful tilework, ropetwist columns, intricate leaded glass in the fenestration--if not stained--employed in the tower.Â  Not all at once, though.Â  Even I have my limits.Â  (But there&#039;s a pile of crisp 8x10s out there, somewhere, that explains all.)

Thanks for that--don&#039;t know how I missed it, probably because in the 2/27 article the development school is termed &#034;Jacob Riis Junior High&#034; and among the variety of words I was entering into the search field I think I didn&#039;t quite put in that combo...

					<description><![CDATA[See LA Times, Feb. 8, 1927 article about new trade schools being built.
I can send Nathan a very grainy picture of the old Riis school if e-addresses are exchanged.
Mine: christopher.white@louisville.edu
There are noticeable differences in the photograph from what remains of the structure.  
Most missed is an arched 1st-floor entry under a 2-1/2 story tower with a kind a sleek, streamlined deco aspect and two additional arched windows on second floor of tower.

&lt;p&gt;
Having given a more careful reading to the article you mention (the &lt;i&gt;Times&lt;/i&gt; piece of November â€˜16), I see D&#038;R are indeed the patriarchs of the VDP plus the rest of that Strip of Seventh including yet another I hadnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t mentioned, and another, plus something across the streetâ€¦I should really up and integrate all this into the post above, but weâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />ll leave that for the coffee table book.  Anyway.

1917 is our Big Year.  Again, here is a shot of pre-Dodd and Richards Seventh:

Yes, that giant building at the far left, above, is the H-M.  It was built with basement and sub-basement to take multiple stories, and, as was often reported, they built two with the intention of constructing the rest in the future.  Of course, ninety-nine times out of a hundred, the H-M included, no-one got around to the fulfilling the original design.

Dodd and Richards are the architects.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Its neighbor is of course the Ville.  Dodd and Richards design it as red pressed brick and terra cotta and, and as Christopher points out, its most distinctive design element are the ornamental towers at each corner.

It is to be built as four stories but, guess what, its foundations are designed to carry two more floors at some...later date.  Of course it too is &#034;towered&#034; in ways that never reach fruition.&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3325/3415431453_ab420d96fb_o.gif&quot; alt=&quot;coultdrygoodco&quot; height=&quot;249&quot; width=&quot;465&quot; /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
One can just make out the Henning hiding out there.  Most notable is its roofline of steeply-pitched slate.  It is finished in terra cotta and fitted with ornamental iron balconies.  In this early-30s image, one can see that its built form didnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t quite get the Franco-Renaissance treatment.  Where is the fourth-floor-as-gable?  Never trust a rendering.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
That brings us to the Brockman.  In 1917 the entire ground floor of the Brockman Block was remodeled by Dodd and Richards for J. J. Haggartyâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s New York Cloak and Suit Houase and, again, Dodd and Richards additionâ€”an attached building for J. J. Haggarty,  was to be bigger than it ended up being, in this case, it was envisioned as nine stories:

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I mean, look at the size of that beast.  Of course, it is eventually constructed as but a four-story building.  How does one refer to this structure specifically?  The Brockman Addition?  The Haggarty Cloak and Suit Addition?  The &lt;i&gt;Times&lt;/i&gt; just calls it â€œThe New Yorkâ€ which is pretty nifty.

Then, across the street and down a bit at the northwest corner of Seventh and Grand, the eight-floor Central Properties Building.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

Well, no, the Central Properties Building building was never built, as here&#039;s a 30s shot of the northwest corner (on the other side of the 1912 Bronson Block AKA Brack Shops and the Quinby Bldg).  And that&#039;s no eight-story D&#038;R.  There&#039;s a low-rise 1980 there now.&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3614/3416400141_2f87ac24ef_o.gif&quot; alt=&quot;grand7th&quot; height=&quot;472&quot; width=&quot;545&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That&#039;s the tale of the five-in-a-row, literally and chronologically, Dodd and Richards along Seventh.  Plus the sixth and seventh, unrealized...at least as best I now understand it! --Nathan

Having given a more careful reading to the article you mention (the <i>Times</i> piece of November â€˜16), I see D&amp;R are indeed the patriarchs of the VDP plus the rest of that Strip of Seventh including yet another I hadnâ€™t mentioned, and another, plus something across the streetâ€¦I should really up and integrate all this into the post above, but weâ€™ll leave that for the coffee table book.  Anyway.

<p>Weâ€™ll start with a shot of looking west down Seventh across Hill toward Olive.  Weâ€™re between 1912 and 1917 because the two most prominent buildings are the towering Brockman, background left at Seventh and Olive, and the <a href="http://www.you-are-here.com/downtown/athletic_club.html" title="laac" target="_blank">LAAC</a>, right.  Foreground right, across Hill, the bay windowâ€™d Victorian is the Dillon Building.  The structure with the Omar Cigarette billboard, and the Zara Hotelâ€”well, donâ€™t park your trunks there, for theyâ€™re not long for the world.

<p>Weâ€™ll work up the south side of Seventh beginning with the Huntsberger-Mennell.  Yes, that giant building at the far left, above, is the H-M.  It was built with basement and sub-basement to take multiple stories, and, as was often reported, they built two with the intention of constructing the rest in the future.  Of course, ninety-nine times out of a hundred, the H-M included, no-one got around to the fulfilling the original design.

It is to be built as four stories but, guess what, its foundations are designed to carry two more floors at some&#8230;later date.

<p>
Now, uncharted territory.  Sure, go downtown and there you are, so to speak.  Thereâ€™s the Coulter right next to the Brockman, just as it should be, but wait.  Donâ€™t forget the Dodd and Richardsâ€™ 1917 Henning Building (into which milliner Swobdi moved from Broadway) between the Coulter and the Brockman:

<p>One can just make out the Henning hiding out there.  Most notable is its roofline of steeply-pitched slate.  It is finished in terra cotta and fitted with ornamental iron balconies.  In this early-30s image, one can see that its built form didnâ€™t quite get the Franco-Renaissance treatment.  Where is the fourth-floor-as-gable?  Never trust a rendering.

<p>That brings us to the Brockman.  In 1917 the entire ground floor of the Brockman Block was remodeled by Dodd and Richards for J. J. Haggartyâ€™s New York Cloak and Suit Houase and, again, Dodd and Richards additionâ€”an attached building for J. J. Haggarty,  was to be bigger than it ended up being, in this case, it was envisioned as nine stories:

<p>
<br />
I mean, look at the size of that beast.  Of course, it is eventually constructed as but a four-story building.  How does one refer to this structure specifically?  The Brockman Addition?  The Haggarty Cloak and Suit Addition?  The <i>Times</i> just calls it â€œThe New Yorkâ€ which is pretty nifty.

<p>So thatâ€™s the south side of Seventh, five Dodd and Richards in a row (should you count the Brockman Addition, which you should).  Then, across the street and down a bit at the northwest corner of Seventh and Grand, the eight-floor Central Properties Building.

<p>Thatâ€™s <i>six</i> Dodd and Richards.  Well, no, the Central Properties Building building was never built, as here&#8217;s a 30s shot of the northwest corner (on the other side of the 1912 Bronson Block AKA Brack Shops and the Quinby Bldg).  And that&#8217;s no eight-story D&amp;R.  There&#8217;s a low-rise 1980 there now.<img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3614/3416400141_2f87ac24ef_o.gif" alt="grand7th" height="472" width="545" />

Now letâ€™s throw something ELSE into the mix:  Dodd and Richardsâ€™ Harris and Frank building, at the northwest corner of Seventh and Hill.

(Again, note how they calm down the ornamented towers.)

Instead, Alexander Pantages gets ahold of the spot and plops <a href="http://jpg3.lapl.org/pics37/00068285.jpg" title="pantygues" target="_blank">one of his signature Pritecaâ€™s</a> <a href="http://www.oac.cdlib.org/affiliates/images/cpom/kt6s2019xp/hi-res/F/F4242.jpg" title="cute" target="_blank">there</a>, which opens <a href="http://helios.library.ca.gov/soca/behrman/behr-0009.jpg" title="earlypantages" target="_blank">August 1920</a>.

<p>
That&#8217;s the tale of the five-in-a-row, literally and chronologically, Dodd and Richards along Seventh.  Plus the sixth and seventh, unrealized&#8230;at least as best I now understand it! &#8211;Nathan

William J. became acutely ill while traveling with his wife Ione in Europe. He returned to the states and died within a week in an LA hospital.  That Ione continued the European tour (with her sister) could imply that William&#039;s sudden sickness was not a cause for alarm when it overtook him.  His funeral was delayed two weeks to accommodate Ione&#039;s return to LA from abroad. 1975 De Mille Drive does seem to be the Dodd residence in June of 1930.  
Dodd had made himself a millionaire by the time of his death but he was over-extended in real estate holdings and risky oil speculations on the eve of the stock market crash. Tracking his widow&#039;s attempts to liquidate assets and handle outstanding debts, foreclosures and liens (borrowing from wealthy friends), as well as her involvement in a decade of legal fallout from Los Angeles oil well scams, this researcher infers a sad, last chapter to the brilliant Dodd legacy adrift into obscurity.   All of this is to say, I am so very excited by the growing interest in Dodd&#039;s work that Mr. Marsak and this OnBunkerHill.org readership appear to be creating among Los Angelenos. Could this become a buzz among the &#034;Conservancy Cats&#034;, too?

					<description><![CDATA[When I was researching Dodd in the UCLA Young Special Collections Library, a few years ago, I came across correspondence between Dodd and Lloyd Wright Jr.  Junior was landscaping for Dodd on residential projects (including Dodd&#039;s own 5226 Linwood Drive residence being built at the time) and later did additions to some other Dodd structures.  

Junior makes two references to working at a Dodd project in Altadena.   There is a 1920 citation about landscaping the property for Dodd and then a 1928 citation about doing an addition to the residence on the same property. Remember those dates.  
In both citations the property is identified as the home of Mr. and Mrs. Frank H. Upham and the address is consistently given as 1943 Mendocino in Altadena, and the citations are in a file that is exclusively work done for Dodd &amp; Richards.

I believe the property still stands at the intersection of Mendocino Lane and Glenview, but now has a street number of 1955 Mendocino Lane.  However, the earliest, nonauthoritative dates I have found online for that house is 1926 and 1928 with builders listed as Glover and Kauth but the designer is unknown.  From my vantage point in Louisville, looking at satellite photos, the house appears to be a compound so it could have been worked on at different times by different designers.  

There you have it.

&lt;p&gt;
Mr. White,&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Very&lt;/i&gt; glad you enjoyed my post, and especially that you liked the wise crackery.  Sort of the West Coast version of your marvelous Wiki page--where such effrontery is frowned upon!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
(A lady-friend years back hailed from Salem, so of course we stayed in Louisville, and I immediately wanted to stay.  I didn&#039;t realize a decade ago I was in Dodd Central.) 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You know, I had scribbled something in my notes about the 1918 Howard Leland Rivers house in Oak Glen as it was mentioned in the ArchitectsDB, but just now found the image on &lt;a href=&quot;http://books.google.com/books?id=ig_kCEOqOIEC&#038;pg=PA26&#038;dq=%22william+james+dodd%22&#038;lr=&#038;ei=uDDPSbGFKYHMlQT0rdyjAQ#PPA27,M1&quot; title=&quot;oakglenhouse&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;p. 26&lt;/a&gt;  of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Glen-Rios-Rancho-Images-America/dp/0738546534&quot; title=&quot;arkybook&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Arcadiaâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s book on Oak Glen/Los Rios Rancho&lt;/a&gt;.  Iâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />d go photograph it myself, though itâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s a bit far afield.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Altadena is (comparatively) my neck of the woods, thoughâ€”where is this mysterious Dodd?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thanks again for your interest and comments...I think I&#039;ve got the Huntsberger down to the Brockman figured out (up to and including their neglected Henning Building), but then there&#039;s the Harris and Frank across the street...hmmm...more soon.
&lt;/p&gt;
