In fact, each of the swabbies was positively desperate to get out of uniform and back into civilian life, so they hatched a plan to get themselves discharged from the service.</span></p>
<p><!--break--><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black; font-family: Arial"></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black; font-family: Arial">The young men had heard that if they were arrested for a crime, their naval careers would come to a screeching halt â€“ so they burglarized a small tobacco store at Fourth and Hill Streets. They made no attempt to flee following the crime, and were busted at the scene by Police Detectives Simpson and Jarves.</span></p>

If so, they must have been very disappointed. Although they were immediately discharged at San Pedro as expected, all three youths were then taken into custody, and confined in the City Jail for six months each on the burglary rap.</span></p>

In fact, theyâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />d already survived a shoot out with one posse, and it would take at least one more to bring them to justice.

Southern Pacific Railroad had cut a ruthless swath through <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:state w:st="on">California</st1:state></st1:place>, displacing people and gobbling up their land, so when Evans and Sontag struck out at the much despised company, people cheered.Â <br />

<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><em><img loading="lazy" border="0" width="240" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3106/2759730283_9c45c04341_m.jpg" alt="sontag death" height="153" /></em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><em>John Sontag near death as posse looks on.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">Neither children nor Pinkerton Detectives ended up capturing Evans and Sontag. On May 28, 1893, the bandits were surrounded by a posse of local lawmen, and a furious gun battle ensued. Both men were wounded. Sontag died of his injuries, but Evans managed to escape. He came upon the home of Mrs. Parsons, who invited him in, and then dressed his wounds and put him to bed. Evans knew that his career as a train robber had ended, and he agreed to let Mrs. Parsons turn him in to the law if she would agree to split the reward she received with his wife â€“ which she promptly did.Â <br />
</span><span style="font-size: 11pt"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"></span><span style="font-size: 11pt">While Evans was awaiting trial, his wife and daughter were contacted by a <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on">San Francisco</st1:city></st1:place> theater company. The girls were offered money to appear as themselves in a production about one of the train robberies. Both mother and daughter agreed, putting the money theyâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />d earned in a defense fund for Chris.<span>Â  </span>It was to no avail however, and Evans was sentenced to prison for life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"></span><span style="font-size: 11pt"><img loading="lazy" border="0" width="345" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3091/2759730263_79dcd6c15c.jpg" alt="evans playbill" height="500" /></span></p>

Evans managed to escape from jail before he could be transported to Folsom Prison. <span>Â </span>After a brief taste of freedom, he was recaptured. Evans served his time and was released in 1911. He died in a state hospital a few weeks later.</span></p>

But she hadnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t â€“ not by a long shot.

<p style="margin: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
It was May 27, 1905, and Mrs. Clark was tidying up around the place. She may have been reflecting on the odd assortment of lodgers currently in residence, particularly Professor J. Maclane. The so-called professor advertised himself as a spiritualist, and Mrs. Clark and her renters were treated to the nightly spectacle of his devotees floating about the premises, seeking to commune with deceased spirits.
</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
<img loading="lazy" border="0" align="middle" width="255" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3289/2696142670_29b310409f_o.jpg" alt="Prof Maclane" height="97" />Â 
</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
While she mused about the spiritualist fakir, itâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s unlikely that she gave any thought at all to Mr. and Mrs. Harry Holley, a pleasant married couple who had moved into the house a few days earlier.<span>Â  </span>They had been occupying a room on an upper floor, but when the larger room adjacent to them became available, theyâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />d jumped at the chance to rent it.Â 
</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
Because the Holleys were out for the day, the landlady decided to do the couple a favor, and began to move some of their belongings into their new room.<span>Â  </span>It was probably the last time in her life that Mrs. Clark would act on a generous impulse. When she swung the door open and entered the room, she nearly stepped on an enormous slithering reptile!<span>Â  </span>Quickly looking around to assess any further danger, she spied another, even larger snake coiled up in a chair across the room. The serpent met her gaze and began to hiss, and that was enough for the landlady. She slammed the door and careened down the stairs, screaming for help.

The panic stricken woman phoned the local precinct house, saying â€œSend some policemen and a patrol wagon quick, my house is full of snakes!â€<span>Â  </span>To which the jaded desk sergeant replied â€œSnakes, eh, you say you gotâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />em?â€<span>Â  </span>If she could have done so, the exasperated woman would have reached through the telephone lines and throttled the cop into unconsciousness.<span>Â  </span>Finally, after what must have seemed like an eternity to the anxious Mrs. Clark, the desk sergeant said that heâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />d connect her with the police surgeon, Dr. Quint, whom the bluecoat declared was an â€œâ€¦authority on snakesâ€.

Across the crackling telephone wire, Dr. Quint heard someone say â€œIs that the snake doctor?â€ Dr. Quint told the shaken woman that heâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />d been called many things in his time, but never a snake doctor. Mrs. Clark then recounted her tale of serpents, fakirs, and terror â€“ oh my. The good doctor suggested that she simply wait for her snake handling lodgers to return, and then demand that they remove the creatures at once.

The Holleys arrived home to find all of the inhabitants of 421 S. Hill Street milling about in the yard, except for Professor Maclane, who was no doubt busy communicating with spirits of the dearly departed.<span>Â  </span>Mrs. Clark strode up to the couple and demanded that they remove the reptiles from the premises at once. Mr. Holley admitted that there were dozens of serpents sharing his room, but <span class="fieldvalue">firmly stated</span> that he would do no such thing. Heâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />d paid for the room for one week in advance, and he flatly refused to budge.

For the next few days an uneasy silence fell over the <st1:street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">Hill Street</st1:address></st1:street> boarding house.<span>Â  </span>The residents remained behind locked doors in mortal terror, fearful of every little sound. Mrs. Clark stayed in her room to keep a close watch on her three kittens. She was convinced that the Holleys were plotting to feed the adorable little mousers to the nefarious vipers.

We can only presume that the uncomfortable situation resolved itself peaceably, and that neither kittens nor humans were harmed, for there were no further reports of snake activity at the house on <st1:street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">Hill Street</st1:address></st1:street>.
