Accursed rings!  Hammer-mad Japanese!  Arms-manufacturing Baronesses!  Welcome to Zelda.</p>
<p>Somewhere in Los Angeles there”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s a burglar who”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s made off with more than he”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s bargained for”¦<i>a maharajah”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s curse</i>.  Somebody stole into the Zelda Apartments in March of 1941 and there into the room of Mrs. F. S. Tintoff, making off with a 400 year-old ring that held two large stones, a ruby and an emerald, surrounded by small diamonds.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3151/2726620001_e3c8a3d0ec_o.gif" alt="DeathCurse!" height="117" width="575" /></p>
<p>“It was given to me by my husband, a jeweler, who purchased it from a maharajah.  The ring formerly adorned an East India princess, and was supposed to have been given a mysterious Oriental curse which would bring death to the person who stole it,” said Mrs. Tintoff.    The burglar took other jewelry which with the ring had a value of $560 ($8,196 USD2007), and two other tenants in the apartment building reported similartly burgled jewelry losses to police, but nothing thereof with a curse upon”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t.  The Tintoff ring thus joins other bloodstained jewels of the East, like the <a href="https://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/science/article2935508.ece" title="Dehlicious" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dehli Purple Sapphire</a>, the <a href="https://www.underworldtales.com/hope.htm" title="eyeforaneye" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stolen</a>-from-the-Eye-of-Sita <a href="https://www.pbs.org/treasuresoftheworld/a_nav/hope_nav/hnav_level_2/level2_pitch_curse_hopfrm.html" title="abandonhope" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hope</a> <a href="https://www.pbs.org/treasuresoftheworld/a_nav/hope_nav/main_hopfrm.html" title="cantwejustgiveitback" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Diamond</a> and the similarly snatched <a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/4262862.stm" title="orlovofmoney" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black Orlov</a>.  And that deadly ring of <a href="https://www.unsolvedmysteries.com/usm352194.html" title="verysheik" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Valentino</a>.</p>
<p>Did our housebreaker lose this cursed thing to the ages as he writhed in some forlorn torment somewhere?  Were his last days exactly like <a href="https://www.vnn.org/editorials/ET0204/ET22-7278.html" title="justatypicalweekonbunkerhill" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this</a>?  Or perhaps the curse was purely <a href="https://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article1596823.ece" title="curseofthelawyers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">legalistic</a>. </p>
<p>What, or who, is Zelda?  Zelda La Chat (nÃ©e Keil) was born in 1870, arriving in Los Angeles some time in the 90s.  She builds the eponymous Zelda, a modest bargeboard affair at the southwest corner of <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=401+S+Grand+Ave,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90071&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=69.738802,113.203125&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=34.052819,-118.252652&amp;spn=0.009138,0.013819&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr" title="401SG" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fourth and Grand</a>, here, about 1904:</p>

She lives therein until she dies of cerebral hemorrhage in 1926; she leaves an estate valued at $300,000 ($3,521,554 USD2007).</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3146/2730395798_6552405280_o.gif" alt="baronesstodust" align="left" height="239" width="250" />Zelda wasn”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t the only wealthy woman to die in the Zelda–Baroness Rosa von Zimmerman, who with her husband the Baron were second only to Krupps when to it came to weapons manufacturing for various Teutonic scraps, lived at the Zelda and died there, an alien enemy, in 1917, leaving Rosamond Castle, on fourteen acres, <a href="https://www.pasadenacal.com/architectural_tours/Oak_Knoll.html" title="pasadenafu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">across</a> from the Huntington Hotel; eleven acres in Beverly Hills; and thirty-four acres in the Palisades near Santa Monica; and about $2.5million in mortgages, bonds and securities.  Nine year-old Beatrice Denton, to whom Baroness von Zimmerman was benefactress, was supposed to be a beneficiary of the estate, but the Baroness never got around to those formalities.  Foundling Beatrice became once again an orphan and was likely returned to the asylum from which she was plucked.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3131/2726620093_eb0dbe667a_o.gif" alt="assaultsuccessor" align="left" height="111" width="429" />Yes, there&#8217;s never a lack of excitement at the Zelda. Take by example the May 1916 discharge of Zelda”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s porter George “an erratic Japanese” Nakamoto. Having been sacked by La Chat, and replaced by one K. Kitagawa, Nakamoto saw fit to return to the Zelda to seek out his successor. There was Kitagawa, crouched low, tacking down oilcloth in a cubbyhole beneath a stairway; Nakamoto grabbed a riveting hammer and struck him repeatedly on the head, injuring his skull, and sending him to Receiving hospital in critical condition.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3287/2726615643_ed65db3e35_o.gif" alt="damestoo" align="right" height="218" width="257" />And then there was the night of March 10, 1939, when vice squads in Los Angeles in Beverly Hills came down on bookmaking establishments; seventeen were arrested, including James Adams, 48; George Taylor, 24; James Roberts, 26; Mrs. Agnes Meyers, 36, and Yvonne Lucas, 21, whom Central Vice took offense to the making of book in an apartment at the Zelda. (Interestingly, across Hollywood and Beverly Hills, the pinched bookmakers more often than not had names like Murray Oxhorn and Morris Levine and Saul Abrams and Joseph Blumenthal; could our Zelda perchance have been a bit”¦<i>restricted</i>?)</p>
<p>Postwar Zelda was full of fun too. Joseph M. Marcelino, 21, was just another ex-Marine who worked in a box factory. When he got nabbed on October 4, 1950, while burglarizing an apartment in the Gordon at 618 West 4th, he copped to having set fire to the Zelda, aflame at that very moment. He admitted as well to torching another hotel at 322 South Spring. He was freed without bail pending a psychiatric examination. But come April, when he broke into a factory at 1013 Santa Barbara Ave. and stole company checks, which he made payable to himself and cashed, the police came knocking.<br />
<img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3258/2727440112_6a357b4591_o.gif" alt="andforgery" height="101" width="440" />Marcelino had also attempted to lift a safe and had lost part of his fingernail in the process–the cops found they had the perfect match.</p>
<p>But the winds of change blew foul in 1954. Sure, people waved their arms and preached the evils of gingerbread ornament and its relationship to tuberculosis, but when you came right down to it, <i>The Hill impeded traffic flow</i>. A new project, known as the 4th Street Cut, began that Summer, involving a 687-foot viaduct shooting eastward from the Harbor Freeway, carrying four lanes of one-way traffic above Figureora and Flower, then biting into the hill and passing beneath bridges at Hope and Grand before dipping down into the business district. Through the early 1950s there was much controversy over this plan–proponents of a tunnel argued that a cut would “hopelessly bisect” Bunker Hill. What they didn”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t realize was that soon enough, there”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />d be no Bunker Hill to bisect.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3041/2726620439_b5047b79ff_o.gif" alt="whyaduck" height="476" width="575" /></p>
<p>
Fourth Street, in becoming a cut, and Grand, in becoming a bridge, meant one thing: the surrounding buildings would have to go. And so they did. The Zelda was razed in August of 1954:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3121/2726619019_ae047e4026_o.gif" alt="demotime" height="414" width="575" /></p>
<p>Seen being demo”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />d next to the Zelda is the Gordon at 618 West 4th (you remember, the place Marcelino was nabbed in in ”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />50); the Gordon, the Bronx at 624 and the La Belle at 630 West 4th were all torn down to make way for the Cut–a trio built by the sons of Dr. <a href="/node/133" title="DrJohn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John C. Zahn</a>.</p>
<p>All this brought a twinge of regret to Percy Howell, the veteran city appraiser who spent two years tramping the Hill, working out fair payments for displaced property owners.  Howell remembered his young bachelor days on Bunker Hill back in 1909, when he moved into the Zelda, “batching it” with three other gay blades.   “I never dreamed then,” said Howell, “that I would live to see the day when I condemned the Zelda for the city.”<br />

<p>The 4th Street Cut opened May 1, 1956.</p>
<p>A new an improved 4th St., looking east ca. 1964, foundation excavation for the <a href="https://www.you-are-here.com/los_angeles/union_bank.html" title="UBH&amp;A" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Union Bank</a> in the foreground:</p>

<p>Another shot of the viaduct (I know, why-a no chicken?) ca. 1973, during  erection of <a href="https://www.you-are-here.com/los_angeles/bank_america.html" title="youdownwithSPP" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Security Pacific Plaza</a>. </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3028/2726620325_09dfc7b077_o.gif" alt="aerialbh" height="409" width="512" /></p>
<p>For twenty-five years after Zelda”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s demolition, nothing could stem the march of progress:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3031/2726621089_a6605dbb4a_o.gif" alt="unstoppable!" height="517" width="400" /></p>
<p>It has filled in now, to be fair.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3216/2727444870_b817aabfe9_o.gif" alt="4thGrandaerial" height="322" width="575" /></p>

<p>And so goes Zelda La Chat, her Zelda, and 4th Street, though all we have to show for the former glory of 401 South Grand is the pointy backside of <a href="https://www.you-are-here.com/los_angeles/mellon_bank.html" title="MellonHeads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">400 South Hope</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bunker Hill has had many landmarks, but perhaps none so little remembered as the massive foundations lain at <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=431+S+Grand+Ave,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90071&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=68.98527,101.953125&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=34.051948,-118.253381&amp;spn=0.009031,0.012445&amp;t=h&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr" title="431sgrand" target="_blank" rel="noopener">431 South Grand</a> many years ago.  They were great concrete things, poured about the time of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_of_1893" title="GrandOldPanic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Great Panic</a>, or the <a href="https://thehistorybox.com/ny_city/panics/panics_article12a.htm" title="panictheyounger" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lesser Panic</a>, and served as Hill touchstone and reminder of ambitious building projects halted by devious economies.  But L. H. Mills and J. G. Talbott have come along and said <i>fooey</i>!  We reject these in their totality and all they represent, and with that utterly destroyed the foundations and have, in the style of all that is great and noble of the year 1912, set out to build from the ground up the finest apartment hotel available.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3045/2619773022_0f8cf7c8e7_o.gif" alt="theSherwood" height="583" width="575" /></p>
<p>
The building is 75&#215;176”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> and contains 160 rooms.  Despite its vaguely<br />
French Renaissance air, it is named the Nottinghamshire-evoking<br />
<i>Sherwood</i>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3207/2618137049_bc2f89840c_o.gif" alt="Sherwhynot" height="220" width="350" /></p>
<p>The lobby is 50&#215;41”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />, finished in mahogany, its inglenook containing a large fireplace.  Each Sherwood apartment contains a private dressing room with built-in dresser and mirror.  Whereas law stipulates the minimum space for apartment living rooms as 120 square feet, the Sherwood&#8217;s are 190; where the legal minimum for hallways is three feet six inches, Mills and Talbott see that theirs will be six feet across.  Just because.  <br />

<p>In June of 1915, the Sherwood hosted the wedding of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0366742/" title="thegreatPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">P. C. Hartigan</a> and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0366473/" title="bestillmybeatinghart" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Peggy Hart</a>, in the apartments of their pal, Sherwoodian Mrs. Dick Ferris, and in the company of Judge Summerfield and many a jolly Hollywood pal.<br />

Soon after, however, the quality of Hollywood Type there began to decline.  Even in our TMZ era that abjures accomplishment and rewards reprobation, dag, that <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0941745/" title="HLW" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Helen Lee Worthing</a> gave society a run for its money.  And surely set Sherwood tongues a-wagging.</p>

Darling of the rotogravure section, it was then on to Hollywood, where she made pictures galore while at the same time gracing nightly Ziegfeld”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s well-known assemblage of pulchritude.</p>
<p>She”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />d always had a tempestuous time of it”¦in 1922, after a Hearst paper described in detail Worthing&#8217;s New York catfight with another chorus girl–including a cartoon depicting the biting and clawing–she elected to end her life by swallowing bichloride of mercury.  Ended up in Bellevue.</p>
<p>Once in Hollywood she made the papers in more light-hearted ways; in 1925 she drove her car off a cliff and from there atop the roof of a house in Whitley Heights.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3025/2620005226_37bfba4d52_o.gif" alt="hlw2" align="left" height="350" width="245" /><br />
But her career continued to blossom; Mary Pickford called her the most beautiful woman in the world, and  <a href="https://www.illustration-house.com/bios/fisher_bio.html" title="HF" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Harrison Fisher</a> adjudged her the most beautiful profile in America.  In 1926–the year she starred with Barrymore in <i>Don Juan</i>–she demanded $100,000 from a perfume company that had used her image.</p>
<p>But 1927 was to change all that.  In April she was the victim of a violent beating, administered by an intruder, which left her with a broken nose, knocked-out tooth and discolored eyes.  And five days of delirium.  Her colored maid called Dr. Eugene Nelson, noted Negro physician, to see after her famous employer.  </p>
<p>And it was love!  They threw society”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s strictures aside (it was still forty years before <i>Loving v. Virginia</i> and eighty til <i>Seal n</i>”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><i> Heidi</i>) and set about on a whirlwind romance that resulted in a secret Tijuana wedding in June.  The fact that there was no intruder, and Nelson had to care for someone in a mad fit of drunkenness (or, more precisely, a drunken fit of madness) should have given him pause.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3241/2620005398_7fc74ebaff_o.jpg" alt="helooksasblackasIdo" align="left" height="241" width="135" />They keep the wedding secret but is revealed to the world late in 1929, after their estrangement becomes known.  His philandering, cruelty, jealously, and threats of confining her to some sort of institution are apparently too much for her.  </p>
<p>In 1930 she returns from a New York “Neurological Institute” where she”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s been treated for&#8230;the blues.  She is outted by a reporter as being shacked up at the Mayfair, and she moves into an unnamed apartment-house; likely The Sherwood, as she turns up there in short order.</p>
<p>Divorce proceedings stretch through the early 30s: she complains that he beats her and drugs her and forces her outside wearing only her negligee; he replies that they didn”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t fulfill Mexican residential requirements and, as they”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />re not therefore legally wed, doesn”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t owe her monthly monies.  By November 1932 she”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s hallucinating that objects are being thrown at her, and is threatening suicide, and lands in the psychopathic ward of General Hospital.  The marriage is annulled in January 1933.</p>
<p>In June of 1933 she disappears from an eastbound Santa Fe train–it is assumed she jumped, or fell.  A three day search ensues.  Turns out she just got off at Pasadena, abandoning her bags and tickets.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3024/2621722712_742b1486dc_o.gif" alt="sherwoodarrest" align="right" height="140" width="252" />On August 16, 1933, the coppers come to The Sherwood to collect Helen Lee Worthing on violation of her parole to the psychopathic department.  In a statement from her psych ward bed at General Hospital, Helen declared that she had been living quietly in her apartment, attempting to increase her income by writing poetry and short stories.  “I can”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t understand who would complain and have me returned here,” she said.  “I have only been trying to get a start on my own ability.  Incidentally, I have fallen in love with a man who has been typing my poetry, but that has nothing to do with this.”</p>
<p>If only the story could end with her returning to the Sherwood, marrying the typist, and living long enough to move into the Bunker Hill Towers.  But it was not to be.  </p>
<p>In 1935 she is arrested on a drunk charge in Venice, and can”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t come up with the $5 bail, or even the pals to post the bail for her; she spend ten days in Lincoln Heights jail.<br />

In 1939 she”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s sentenced to five months in County on a narcotics charge–passing forged morphine scrips and carrying a hypo in her purse.  In 1940 she”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s given a year for the same MO.  (Interestingly, while in stir, going about her duties as a trusty in the woman”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s ward of County, only three flights below was her ex-husband Dr. Eugene Nelson, awaiting his murder trial–not only was he practicing without a license, having lost that–but he killed a girl while aborting her fetus.)</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3022/2621723088_d35189fb00_o.gif" alt="checkup" height="339" width="500" /><br />
In October 1942 she”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s popped for public drunkenness outside a downtown roominghouse; she fails to appear in court for her hearing, but sends a note:  “I am leaving the State.  I do not feel I can get fair treatment in California courts.”  Needless to say, she does not leave the state.  Radio car officers were called to the scene of her beating by some “boyfriend” in her Centennial Street apartment in April 1944, and took her to Georgia Street Receiving where she was treated for half-inch laceration on the chin and a 1+1/2 inch cut on the back of her head; she does not press charges.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3280/2621015543_5c0ca25b9d_o.jpg" alt="uhoh" align="right" height="58" width="217" />In 1946 she”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s found downed and dazed at <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=W+Sunset+Blvd+%26+Portia+St,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90026&amp;sll=34.076585,-118.254368&amp;sspn=0.008549,0.012445&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=34.076585,-118.254368&amp;spn=0.008549,0.012445&amp;t=h&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr" title="thebeginningoftheend" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Portia and Sunset</a>, and examination fails to find injury or illness.  She talks vaguely of trying to obtain rest by “self-hypnosis.”  Uh-huh.</p>
<p>Some would see this as a red flag; others as the checkered flag&#8230;the race is over.  In any event, people will sit in the stands waiting for a spectacular crash.

<p>August 25, 1948.  She dies of barbiturate poisoning, in a tiny house (1062 North Serrano, since wiped out by the Hollywood Freeway) surrounded by expensive scrapbooks bulging with clippings from her golden age.  Inside were penciled notes:  “I can”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t stand another straw–it would be too much.”  Say hello next time you”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />re in <a href="https://www.inglewoodparkcemetery.org/" title="youdownwithIPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Inglewood</a>.</p>

<p>Old Bunker Hill can evoke images of Victorian grander and prosperity, as well as faded glory and great loss. While many associate the history of Bunker Hill with the buildings that once decorated the landscape, the riches to rags stories of the neighborhood also belong to many of its inhabitants. The Rose Mansion at Fourth Street and Grand Avenue was once one of the most picturesque homes on the Hill and its builder and namesake a highly regarded pioneer of Los Angeles County.  Despite a celebrated beginning, the house would be demolished long before the Community Redevelopment Agency (CRA) razed the neighborhood, and its original owner would meet his end in a most macabre manner.</p>
<div style="text-align: center">
</div>
<p>Leonard John Rose (L.J.), was a native of Bavaria who immigrated to New Orleans when he was twelve. He received  an education in Illinois and engaged in early business ventures in Iowa before organizing a party, including his wife Amanda and two children, to travel to California in 1857. After crossing the Colorado River, the group was attacked by a Native American tribe, incurring losses of life and supplies. Rose and his family survived and temporarily settled in New Mexico. The family made it to California in 1860 and established themselves in the San Gabriel Valley.</p>

</div>
<div style="text-align: center">
<i>Sunny Slope Ranch</i> 
</div>
<p>Sunny Slope was the name of the renowned ranch Rose acquired shortly after arriving in Southern California. Located in what is now the eastern end of Pasadena, the 1,900 acre property contained countess lemon, orange and olive trees, but became famous for its vineyards.  Vines were imported from Spain, Italy and Peru, and the wine and brandy generated from Sunny Slope made L.J. Rose a household name and a very wealthy man. He also found success as a breeder with a horse ranch named Rosemead (where the city of the same name now stands), and eventually became a State Senator.</p>
<div align="center">

</div>
<p>In 1887, the somewhat secluded neighborhood of Bunker Hill attracted Rose, and he purchased land at the corner of Fourth and Grand (then called Charity) to build a palatial home for his family that now included nine children. Construction on the house was such a massive undertaking that a scathing editorial appeared in the Los Angeles Times criticizing the builders for piling up so much lumber in the streets that carriages could not pass through.</p>
<p>Designed by architects Curlett &amp; Eissen at a cost of around $50,000 and completed in 1888, the Rose Mansion was a gleaming gem among the jewels of Bunker Hill. The L.A. Times ran a piece dedicated solely to the stained glass widows, designed by Rose&#8217;s son <a href="https://www.guyrose.com/" title="Guy Rose Art" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Guy</a>, who would become a respected Impressionist painter. The Los Angeles Evening Express was so impressed with the stately structure that an extensive article appeared in 1890 describing the interior whose “first and second floors are finished in hard woods and the third in white cedar.” The dining room had a “heavily paneled ceiling” and a bay window with an “elaborately carved arch of oak supported by dragons.” A “heavily carved giant staircase” ran through the house and frescoes by [Attilio] Moretti of San Francisco adorned the ceilings. The home also included a plush library and music room, but the most talked about part of the house was the wine cellar where Rose stored an impressive selection of wines and spirits. On the outside, the most distinct feature of the property was the granite retaining wall surrounding the house with polished steps leading up to the entry.</p>
<div align="center">
<img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3277/2432306327_47e380398a.jpg?v=0" alt="Headline" height="122" width="226" />
</div>
<p>Despite his tremendous success, by 1899 bad investments had left Rose deeply in debt with properties so heavily mortgaged that selling them would have been fruitless. On May 17, a despondent Rose told his wife he was going to Ventura on business and would be returning the next day. Instead, he returned to Los Angeles that night and drafted a suicide note addressed to the his wife at the Mansion, and mailed it. At 10 o&#8217;clock the next morning, Mrs. Rose received the letter with Rose stating financial ruin as the reason for taking his own life. He continued the letter by bidding an affectionate farewell to his family.</p>
<p>Also included was a postscript stating that his body could be found in the backyard of the Mansion.</p>
<p>Family present at the time “were too overwhelmed with apprehension to go to the yard to see whether his dead body was really there.” Mrs. Rose&#8217;s son-in-law was summoned from his office Downtown and upon arrival found “his father-in-law lying face downward in a little hollow at the rear of the lot. His head reclined on his hat, and in one hand was clasped a bunch of carnations.” Miraculously, Rose was still alive and was taken to a hospital where his stomach was pumped to remove the 65 morphine pills he had swallowed. Despite the efforts to save his life, too much of the drug had been absorbed into his system and Leonard John Rose died at the age of 72. The official cause of death was morphine poisoning.</p>

</div>
<p>
L.J. Rose was heavily eulogized by the county he had called home for nearly 40 years and the “courageous pioneer” was laid to rest in Evergreen Cemetery. In the meantime, his wife Amanda was left with a ruined empire and the Mansion was soon lost to foreclosure. After a mere 11 years, the Roses no longer reigned over the house at Fourth and Grand.</p>

<i>Rose Mansion (lower right side)</i>
</div>
<p>The Rose Mansion was briefly occupied by real estate investor Albert W. McCready. In 1903 the residence was purchased by Colonel Albert B. Hotchkiss, creator and editor of the local publication Public Economy, with his wife Mary. <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=%22hotchkiss+park%22&amp;near=Santa+Monica,+CA&amp;fb=1&amp;cid=34006532,-118484103,11423716760271147898&amp;li=lmd&amp;z=14&amp;t=m" title="Hotchkiss Park" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mrs. Hotchkiss</a> , one of the few women in early Los Angeles to make a name for herself in real estate. A colorful character, Mary Hotchkiss at one time owned a large chunk of Main Street and was once accused of abducting a neighbor&#8217;s parrot named “Dude.” Colonel Hotchkiss  died of natural causes inside the mansion and Mary wasted no time in landing husband #3, Dr. J.T. Jauch.</p>

</div>
<p>The Jauches resided at the former Rose Mansion until 1928, when they took up permanent residence at the Fremont Hotel on Fourth and Olive, which Mary owned. The building appears to have remained vacant and in 1935 the State Emergency Relief Administration (SERA) proposed using the residence to house transients. The Health Commission turned this idea down.</p>

</div>
<p>By 1937 the Rose Mansion was supposedly in such disrepair that it was no longer inhabitable. In the biography L.J. Rose of Sunny Slope, the pioneer&#8217;s son claims that the heavy wood paneling was salvaged by 20th Century Fox and used to decorate sets on the Alice Faye/Tyrone Power feature In Old Chicago. When the CRA began its invasion of Bunker Hill in the 1950s, all that remained was the garage and the ghosts of the Rose Mansion and its owners.</p>
