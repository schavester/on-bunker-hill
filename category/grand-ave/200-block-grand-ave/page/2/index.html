<p>For nearly seventy years the Richelieu Hotel resided next door to the better known Melrose. The pair of Queen Anne Victorian buildings were two of the most stunning structures on the Hill, but the Richelieu always stood in the shadow of its counterpart. The Melrose once played host to President McKinley, was memorialized by artists like Leo Politi, and was covered by local press when the wrecking crews came. The Richelieu on the other hand, was far less celebrated but no less important, making its small mark on the history of a neighborhood that no longer exists.</p>

</div>
<p>The Richelieu Hotel was built by Richard E. Larkin and his wife Helen, and opened around 1891. Apparently the hotel was not particularly plush, for when the Larkins sold it to a Chicago business man a mere two years after it was built, the Times reported that “the purchaser will spend considerable money giving the house a thorough overhauling, and will run it as a first class hotel.”&#157; The overhaul was successful, and the Richelieu played host to society gatherings, and many local families and single residents would call the hotel home. Â </p>

<p>
For the most part, the Richelieu maintained a relatively tranquil existence, with a bit of color thrown in here and there. In March of 1901, a bold burglar successfully struck Bunker Hill five times in one night, including the room J.F. Currier was occupying at the Richelieu. The cagey criminal was an expert lock picker who entered Currier&#8217;s room and made off with $150 in cash and a gold pocket watch without disturbing the resident&#8217;s slumber. The hotel was the victim of another burglary in 1904 when thieves entered the room of Mr. &amp; Mrs. Bob Northam. The culprits were lucky that the Northams were out. The couple had been robbed a few months earlier and the Mrs had responded by lodging a bullet in the fleeing burglar. Of the more recent crime, Mrs. Northam expressed regrets that she was not around to take a shot at the thieves.</p>

<p>
In May of 1949, the Times reported that a pair of detectives were investigating a narcotics lead at the Richelieu, when Ricardo Rameriez walked in on the pair. He attempted to quickly walk out, but was nabbed by the detectives who found $800 worth of heroin on him. One of the detectives spotted Rameriez&#8217;s wife waiting in a car down the street and asked her if she wanted to join her husband in jail. “Might as well,”&#157; she said and off she went. The next day, the detectives found the couple&#8217;s $36,000 smack stash at a hotel on Figueroa.</p>

<p>
No Bunker Hill boarding house history would be complete without at least one suicide. The Richelieu&#8217;s came in 1933 when Sylvia Norris, a 55 year old trained nurse, strangled herself in her room with a hose. According to her husband who found her, Mrs. Norris was despondent over ill health.</p>

</div>
<p></p>
<p>One of the Richelieu&#8217;s more interesting residents was Walter Hallowell, who resided at the hotel for at least ten years. In the 1930s, Hallowell was president of the Bunker Hill Non Partisan Voter&#8217;s League and held meetings in his room. By the 1940s, he had established his Richelieu residence as headquarters for the California Shut-In Stamp Club. The club sought donations in order to provide the state&#8217;s some 60,000 shut-ins with stamp collections.Â  Hallowell and the club also offered correspondence courses in short hand, as well as a complete booklet on a variety of ways to play solitaire. Hallowell hoped that the club&#8217;s efforts would “bring some pleasure to a shut-in.”&#157;</p>
<div style="text-align: center">

</div>
<p>
Unlike many of the Victorian structures on Bunker Hill which quickly fell into disrepair, the Richelieu was always well taken care of. In 1939, when the WPA performed a household census of the area, the Richelieu and its thirty-nine units were listed as in “good condition.”&#157; The hotel suffered a fire in 1954, but the damage appears to have been minimal.</p>

</div>
<p>In May of 1956, the Times reported that the interior of the Richelieu was being redecorated and modernized and “perhaps, once again will be a proud residence.”&#157; When the Times extensively covered the demolition of the Melrose a year later, the Richelieu was already gone.</p>

Who fought City Hall; who fought the law, and sure, the law won.   But let’s remember the man.  Firebrand.  Gadfly.  Babcock.</p>
<p>It’s 1951, and we’re faced with Proposition C, which sounded just <i>swell</i>:  clear the city’s slum areas and replace “ramshackle”&#157; tenements with modern apartments.  The Times ran large pieces urging the voters to back C, citing a litany of political, business and union leaders supporting the measure (veterans’ organizations termed the measure “a solution of a vital civic problem in the American way”&#157;).</p>

The Association met before the election and passed a resolution announcing their opposition to Prop C (which would raze Bunker Hill, to be replaced by “12 blocks of new apartment houses”&#157;) whereby property owners would be forced to sell at condemnation prices; BHPOA also saw C as a scheme to take their property for the benefit of insurance corporations.  Be that as it may, the voters decided Proposition C was the American Way (despite the Stalinist overtones of a government taking private property) and it passed.  But you hadn’t heard the last of Frank Babcock.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important not to confuse our Frank Babcock with the anti-Babcock, or Babcock-Bizarro, if you will.  Henry Babcock.  Whether they’re related we do not know, but it does tickle the imagination to think so.  Why?  Because Henry Babcock had been involved in the wholesale demolition of Bunker Hill since 1930.  He arrived in Los Angeles from Chicago as one of William Babcock &amp; Sons, real estate valuators and consultants, to study the feasibility of the “Bigelow Plan”&#157; (C. C. Bigelow’s 1928 scheme for removing the Hill using hydraulic mining equipment) and how quickly a regraded Bunker Hill could be absorbed into downtown.  Henry Babcock in-a-nutshell:</p>

“There is no community, it is found, that is entirely free from spots or sections that by reason of antiquated structures, topographical conditions or congestion have depreciated in value and also are having an adverse effect on adjacent areas.  This is on the principle of the spoiled apple in the barrel.  In fact, directly or indirectly, these depreciated areas threaten a bad effect on entire municipalities.<br>
“They cannot by fenced off and left to their fate.  They cannot be segregated to work out their own salvation regardless of the rest of the community.  Consequently they present a problem of concern to the entire city in which they are situated.  Naturally, the rehabilitation of blighted areas is governed entirely by the conditions involved.<br>
“In the instance of Bunker Hill the matter of topography enters largely into consideration.  Admittedly it is a traffic barrier not only for itself but for extensive and growing sections at every side of it.  Architecturally it has not kept pace with the modernly growing parts of the city.  It apparently presents a striking need for rehabilitation if it is to share in the indicated improvement in realty values.  Modern engineering methods lend themselves expeditiously to the razing of this are or any part of it and without undue interference with a natural volume of traffic with the work is under way.”&#157;
</div>
<p>Babcock, after presenting a ninety-six page report about razing and regrading Bunker Hill to the City Council, decided to stay in Los Angeles as a vice-president of the Mitchel-Brown &amp; Co. Spring-Street investment house.</p>
<p>Then, there was to be a Babcockfight.  Henry Babcock shows up again in 1951 as a consulting engineer for Proposition C.  He outdoes the CRA by drawing up plans for <i>thirty-seven</i> thirteen-story apartment complexes on 73 acres, four 600-car parking garages, and open paved lots for 2560 autos.  Parking and retail buildings were to be located in the center of Bunker Hill.</p>
<p>In February of 1955 Frank Babcock strolled down from his Dome to Superior Court and slapped the Community Redevelopment Agency with an injunction to block the development  (the City, and all the members of the City Council [with the exception of Edward R. Roybal, who’d voted against BH redevelopment] were also named as defendants). <br>
<img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3048/2561500125_c8d23b3839_o.gif" alt="councilready" align="left" height="225" width="179"><br>
Babcock asserted that the law was clear:  the CRA could only demolish blighted areas.  The structures and set-up of Bunker Hill, Babcock argued, met City ordinances’ standards and filled the economic needs of the community, and further contended that (despite common belief and <a href="http://www.allanguthrie.co.uk/5/paul_cain.htm" title="bhnoir" target="_blank">literary assertions</a> to the contrary) Bunker Hill’s buildings were safe for occupancy, not conducive to ill health, transmission of disease, juvenile delinquency, infant mortality or crime.  And, owner of the Dome that he was, was proud to say that landowners on the Hill were planning development of their own properties and had no need for the “aid”&#157; of 40million+ condemnation dollars in taxpayer funds.</p>
<p>By June of 1956, William T. Sesnon, armed with Henry Babcock’s financial, economic and architectural surveys, presented final plans to the City Council.  As required by law, there was a public hearing; Frank Babcock presented his alternate proposals—lost to time, now.  It would seem there was nothing Frank Babcock could do to stem the tide that would wash away Bunker Hill and his beloved Dome.  Until he realized that tide was suffused with <i>brea</i>.  </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3158/2562325908_a8fdc9a024_o.gif" alt="bunkerhilltea" align="right" height="175" width="221">Oil, that is.  William T. Sesnon Jr., chairman of the Community Redevelopment Agency, is an oil magnate, after all.  (&#8216;Twas he who proposed the plan to finance homes for those elderly residents who had to be relocated from Bunker Hill:  the City would drill on property bounded by <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=W+Temple+St+%26+E+Edgeware+Rd,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90026&amp;sll=34.067592,-118.256364&amp;sspn=0.008994,0.013304&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=34.067592,-118.254647&amp;spn=0.008994,0.013304&amp;t=h&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr" title="oilfield" target="_blank">Temple</a>, Beverly, Union and Edgeware—one of LA’s oldest oilfields—and the senior-citizen property owners would receive a one-sixth royalty interest with which they could pay their new rents.)  And Sesnon wanted Bunker Hill for its mineral rights, you see.  And Babcock could prove it were he able to inspect the Agency’s books and records, a request he’d been repeatedly denied.  On June 23, 1958 Babcock demanded the issuance of a writ of mandate to compel the agency to allow him access.  If the idea of oil beneath Bunker Hill sounds nutty, it’s not; but we won’t go into our petroleum reservoir wherefores here.  Babcock should have restrained himself when he charged that the City Council was in on the conspiracy, though.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3079/2562385432_288c142f94_o.gif" alt="thelash" height="63" width="355"></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3124/2561579449_b68afa3eaa_o.gif" alt="ohnoyoudidn" align="left" height="168" width="205">This prompted some strong words on the Chamber floor, where the next day Sesnon himself stood and said in part:  “I regret the necessity of speaking but the action filed yesterday makes it unavoidable.  These charges are irresponsible, malicious, vindictive and utterly false.  No member of the Council ever entered into such a deal.  It is an outrage that we have to face such publicity and I completely resent such statements.”&#157;</p>
<p>Alas, that’s the last we hear of Frank Babcock.  Henry Babcock is mentioned one more time, in August of 1958, testifying before the City Council about the estimated value of a regraded Hill.</p>
<p>The Babcocks go on to watch as the CRA, bit by bit, commandeers umpteen millions from City coffers, displaces 9,000 people, and eventually gobbles up 136 acres.  In the Autumn of 1961 the first CRA-demo’d building goes down—the Hillcrest.  Frank Babcock’s Dome stands proud until she burns in the Summer of ’64.  </p>
<p>Henry Babcock’s city of apartment buildings on the Hill never quite materializes the way he planned it.</p>

Bentz—nephew of M. W. Connor, owner—was in the office when stifling fumes and a dense cloud of smoke began to rise from the floor. He dashed down the stairs and into the basement where, in smoke so dense he nearly suffocated, managed at great length to extinguish the conflagration. Bentz discovered newspapers wadded up between the beams, blackened and scorched.</p>
<p>Bentz and Connor went searching through the house, cellar to garret, for some sign of a stranger, and were about to give up when the office <i>again</i> filled with smoke. Again there was a dash to the basement…nothing. This time the smokey cloud was emerging from the elevator shaft. San Bernardino papers (<i>aha</i>!) were extracted, smoldering, from between wooden beams therein. This time Bentz and Connor summoned the authorites.</p>
<p>Good thing, too, for as Sgt. Hartmeyer approached the Melrose, he saw smoke billowing from the structure…two alarms were sent to the fire department, a door and several windows were broken open, and a large clothes basket, filled with paper, blazing furiously, was doused.</p>
<p>No-one ever found out who the immolator of South Grand was, or what it was they were after. (Whether burning the Melrose inspired Kimberly to firebomb Melrose Place at the end of Season Three is a question, alas, for Darren Star.)<br>

The original Melrose Hotel, 130 South Grand, was a thirty-room, five-story structure built by Marc W. Connor (on what was then called Charity Street) in the summer of 1889. Its architect was Joseph Cather Newsom.Â  It was a center of fashionable goings-on, and society spectacle, and place of repose for honorable peoples.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3039/2497950773_33044c534c_o.gif" alt="melroseca95" width="575" height="453"></p>
<p>(The house in the foreground, 142 S. Grand, is the Robert Larkins residence, which became the Richelieu Hotel ca.1890.)</p>
<p>In early 1902 Connor erected the far more box-like Melrose Hotel, its architect Thomas J. McCarthy, at 120 just to the west of his cupola’d wonder, which became its annex, connected to the hotel proper by an arcade.<br>

<p>The dual Melroses persevered, all ornate of railing and careful of mitering, through the decline of, well, just about everything. By 1957, time had run out for the Melrose (one could say that Melrose place had been, if you will, canceled).</p>

<p>There wasn’t anything left now but for little old ladies to amble by and mutter “oh, dear”&#157; and reminisce “I remember as if it were yesterday—the time President McKinley came to Los Angeles. We all came down and crowded around on the sidewalk—right here, right on this very spot—and listened while he made a speech from the front porch…”&#157;</p>

Here, Mrs. Mary Connor Rasche, whose father Marc W. built the Melrose, poses before her father&#8217;s legacy some weeks before its demolition. (<i>What&#8217;s that</i> lurking in the background?

<p>And so, it being 1957, the Melrose had to go.</p>

“One of the wrecking crew workmen observed that it took more than a<br>

<p>Ah, the March of Progress. One can hear it <a title="stompstomp" href="http://www.laweekly.com/news/news/westsiders-slam-villaraigosas-push-for-apartments-citywide/18845/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">goosestepping</a> along, even now.</p>

<p>Mr. A E. and wife had met Herman J. Siemers at the restaurant, where Herman had lunched daily, and they&#8217;d befriended him, she more than he apparently.  Not that Herman’s offer to Mrs. Stotts of a moonlight horseback ride wasn’t innocent; unfortunately, it’s about the only thing in the world more romantic than consumption.  This apparently riled A. E.</p>
<p>It’s the Friday afternoon of November 11, 1932, and Mrs. Stotts has gussied herself up in full riding gear for a gallop in Rustic Canyon—Herman Siemers was a member of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rustic_Canyon,_Los_Angeles,_California#History" title="theUL" target="_blank">Uplifter’s</a> <a href="http://www.inthecanyon.com/history/history/pg3.htm" title="yonhistory" target="_blank">Club</a>,<a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9501EFDB1E3DF93BA25752C0A9679C8B63" title="bastard" target="_blank"> hoo ha</a>! Siemers bounded up the stairs of the Stott’s Alto Hotel, with all the good health of a man <i>not</i> wasting away from the inside, knocked on the door, and Mrs. Stotts opened.  The two were not aware of the firearm-equipped white-plague addled Mr. Stotts lurking in the dark shadows.<br>

Mr. A. E. lept from the depths and fired one shot into her heart.  He turned on Siemers but elected not to keep to his chest shot MO:  though at very close range, one bullet went through the crown of Siemers’s hat, another grazed his left temple as it tore through the hat brim, another burned a path across his right temple on taking out the hat brim’s other side.  A fourth bullet struck Siemers in his right leg.</p>
<p>A. E., having done all he could do and with but one bullet left, dashed to the fire escape, smashed the window pane with his revolver, stepped out on the landing, placed the muzzle to his right temple and fired. </p>
<p>Siemers ended up in <a href="http://silverlake.tribe.net/photos/c686a18c-c1aa-4d27-b9bb-d18eb879ea50" title="MSH" target="_blank">Monte Sano</a> hospital with a broken leg, a powder burned face, and an irreparably damaged hat; Mr. and Mrs. Stotts in the grave, and the Alto with a newly vacant apartment.</p>

<p>Monday, January 14, 1963</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3005/2438460489_8dc71b93c1_o.gif" alt="jumperlong" align="left" height="896" width="200">Bunker Hill’s final days, after its Official Designation as blighted slum, evokes not only decrepit dandified buildings like the Dome, but also its downtrodden denizens, shuffling along, infused with all the despair and longing and hopelessness you’d expect from folks in a blighted slum.  It being Official, after all.  </p>
<p>Victor Palomino, 29, was one such shuffler.  He was another resident of the <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/theDome" title="anotherDomer" target="_blank">Dome</a>, who’d actually been fine and dandy until Friday last when he was canned from his gig as a carpenter at the Civic Center project.  He brooded over the wintry weekend and at mid-afternoon on a jobless Monday, thought to himself as had another of his carpenter brethren, why hast thou forsaken me? and decided to shuffle from the Dome a couple hundred feet to the northeast to the corner of First and Hope.  </p>
<p>There stood the great steel frame of the <a href="http://www.you-are-here.com/los_angeles/dwp.html" title="acmartindwp" target="_blank">Department of Water and Power building</a>.  Like King Kong, frustrated, recently out of a job, though trading Skyscraper Deco for Corporate Modern, Victor climbed fourteen stories of the skeleton and perched on a narrow I-beam 220 feet above the earth.  Would the four children of his pregnant common-law wife Angie, 21, ever see him again?  Would the seven children from his previous wife ever see him again? (Why is it residents of the Dome so like to <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/sickmanjumps" title="sickmanjumps" target="_blank">leap</a>?)</p>
<p>For three tense hours he screamed he was going to jump.  Angie and his priest screamed back (presumably for him not to, not “Jump! Jump!”&#157;) but it was Milt Borik, project manager for <a href="http://www.emporis.com/en/cd/cm/?id=gustknewbergconstructionco-chicago-il-usa" title="GKN" target="_blank">Gust K. Newberg</a>, who finally coaxed Victor down with the promise of his job back.</p>
<p>It was a ruse.  After Victor came down, he didn’t go back to his home in the Dome, with is bays and spindles, its hands at two minutes to midnight, in direct aesthetic if not moral opposition to LA&#8217;s true <a href="http://www.ladwp.com/ladwp/cms/ladwp001562.jsp" title="mulfalls" target="_blank">Mulholland Fountain</a>, no; Victor’s in Central Receiving under psych-ob, and he’ll be there for a little while.<br>

		<p>Date:  March 26, 1947</p>
<p>Having described the <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/theDome" title="dadome" target="_blank">Dome</a> to you in some detail, we figured it would be in the interest of OBH readers to be kept <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/DomeDenizenSmith" title="bgirl" target="_blank">abreast</a> of the hotel’s <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/sickmanjumps" title="jumper" target="_blank">tenants</a>.  Enter Carl F. Brannon.</p>
<p>Carl called 201 South Grand home.  He worked down at the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/79761301@N00/2378839160/" title="gowayne" target="_blank">Simon’s Drive-In</a> at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=S+Figueroa+St+%26+Exposition+Blvd,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90007&amp;jsv=107&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=68.98527,108.984375&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=34.019034,-118.282413&amp;spn=0.009035,0.013304&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr" title="simonize" target="_blank">3607 South Figueroa,</a> as manager no less.  A man of quality.  And bravery, to take on such a dangerous job.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3110/2426104724_e73b2b8811_o.gif" alt="notthesimonsonfig" align="left" height="350" width="265">Dangerous?  Yes!  Brannon was held up by two men, robbed of $1,000, and slashed with a razor blade when he courageously resisted.  </p>
<p>Detective Sgts. Lambert and Thedens of Univeristy Division quizzed him all about the incident, and that fishy smell, the one that didn’t emanate from Simon’s deep-fryer.  Police Forensic Chemist Ray Pinker gave Brannon’s superficial wounds a look-see, and let’s face it, it’s <i>hard</i> to slash yourself.  </p>
<p>Turns out Brannon had lost heavily in the Vegas gambling houses (running afoul of the El Rancho, Last Frontier, and Benji Siegel’s newly opened Flamingo, no doubt) and took the money to make good on his losses.  $861 was found in a crock in Simon’s storeroom.  </p>
<p>Brannon’ll spend a little time in stir before he slinks his sad-slashed self back to the Dome.</p>

		<p>Location: 201 South Grand Avenue<br>
Date: June 9, 1931</p>
<p>Richard Veit, mechanic, resident of the Minnewaska, aged 67 (or so it appears, through the blotchy ink of the news clipping), took his life today by leaping from the eastern end of the Second Avenue tunnel. He was gravely injured, but managed to tell detectives he had been chronically ill for many years and wanted to die, which he soon did after arrival at Georgia Street Receiving Hospital. He left a note to a Mrs. F.A. Schofield in Chicago directing her to dispose of his property there.</p>

		<p>July 14, 1949</p>
<p>Grace E. Smith made the Dome her home.  From there she made the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=1069071389578867972,34.052220,-118.250030&amp;saddr=201+S+Grand+Ave,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90012&amp;daddr=426+S+Hill+St,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90013&amp;sll=34.052197,-118.251858&amp;sspn=0.009031,0.015814&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=34.052144,-118.252115&amp;spn=0.009031,0.015814&amp;z=16" title="roundaboutway" target="_blank">trek to work</a> down to the Belmont Grill.  It’s 1949.  She’s a B-girl.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2010/2362641520_02d623eb9d_o.gif" alt="domeup2ndfromolive" height="350" width="500"></p>
<p>Vice has been coming down on prosties of late and joints like the Belmont that run B-girl operations are a thorn in the side of decent society.  The racket is simple:  the gals chat up the fellas, and as a gal mingles with the patrons she induces them to buy more drinks.  Her bourbons are colored water or ice tea; she gets a commission of those sales.  And if she takes off with her new friend, we’ll call him, oh, John, the tavern owner gets a cut of her earnings.  Repeat.  </p>
<p>After a while Vice gets tired of dealing with pimp beat downs, or customers given the mick finn, so it’s time to round up the ladies.  Grace E. Smith, 28, won’t get to go home to her little room at the Dome tonight, popped as she was at the Belmont for violating the municipal B-girl ordinance.  Tomorrow morning she’ll be out on $100 bail.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2379/2362444800_a5d3bd974c_o.gif" alt="b-elmont" height="416" width="500"></p>
<p>Grace&#8217;s boss Nathan Bass, owner of the Belmont, has been supbeanoed to testify before the county grand jury in its current vice inquiry into the <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,853775,00.html" title="allentown" target="_blank">Brenda Allen</a> police pay-off probe.  (Bass had been in the news last month when he, as a pal of LAPD Lieutenant Wellpott, had wiretaps of his phone calls played at the PD/Allen vice hearings.)  Bass went on to testify that famously dirty Sgts. Stoker and Jackson would meet in the Belmont. </p>
<p>The next mention of Grace E. Smith—one wonders if it&#8217;s she and the same—is in 1953:  a Lena S. Reed, 72, was to leave her $8,000 estate ($61,857 USD 2007) to her family but just before her demise opted to bequeath it to Mrs. Edna W. “Mail Fraud”&#157; Ballard (aka St. Germain, aka Joan of Arc, aka Lotus Ray King), cofounder of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22I_AM%22_Activity" title="ImNot" target="_blank">I AM</a> religious movement.  A judge blocked probate when the family filed contest, accusing Mrs. Ballard of “exerting undue influence on Mrs. Reed while she was in ill health and mentally disturbed.”&#157;  The same accusations were made against the secretary of the organization’s St. Germain Foundation, and executor of the will, one Grace E. Smith.</p>
<p>No mention as to whether this Grace E. Smith lived in the Dome.</p>

		<p>The Minnewaska, aka The Dome, played host to no small quantity of characters over the course of her life.  Over the course of this blog you’ll be introduced to your fair share of them.  Here then is a brief introduction to this, their home.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2383/2363258642_cce2deb895_o.gif" alt="minnie1903" height="488" width="550"></p>
<p>Our first mention of the Minnewaska comes in the form of this notice regarding building permits, January 11, 1903:<br>
<img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3077/2363363716_11d9d7833d_o.jpg" alt="minniebldngpermit" align="middle" height="122" width="261"><br>
She is completed within the year and on December 20 described in the <i>Times</i> thusly:</p>
<div align="justify">
…recently completed by J M Shield on the southwest corner of Grand avenue and Second street…the location, only three blocks from Broadway and Second street, and near the highest point of Olive Heights, is one which is both desirable and commanding.<br>
The house is a four-story combination frame and cement structure with tower.<br>
Its foundation is a heavy brick wall imbedded in solid red gravel.  Very heavy dimension timbers were used as the owner contemplated adding two or more stories to the building at some time in the future.  The outer walls are covered with heavy diagonals and on this surface is placed steel lath and two coats of cement plaster.  The latter is tinted a delicate cream color, which gives the building a very pleasing exterior.
</div>
<div align="justify">
The interior is arranged in flats of two and four rooms each, which are supplied with private baths, marble-topped wash stands, electric bells, steam heat, and such other modern conveniences as are usually found in the best apartment hotels.<br>
The house contains 122 guests’ rooms and thirty-seven bathrooms, besides dining-room, kitchen, storeroom, cold-storage and furnace rooms, office and reception-room.  The latter are finished in paneled oak and have decorated ceilings.<br>
The apartments are finished in white cedar, and are so arranged that each room can be entered from a hall.  The building could therefore be easily converted into a regular commercial hotel.<br>
Its main hall is arranged as an open court, and its roof garden affords a view of the surrounding country that extends from the mountains to the sea.<br>
The building cost about $65,000.  The lot on which it stands extends westward to Bunker Hill avenue and affords space for an extension to the present building that would give it a frontage of about 400 feet on the three streets and a total of 200 guests’ rooms.
</div>
<p>Sold in 1905, the Minnewaska remains so named in the city directories until 1907, when she becomes, simply and more descriptively, the Dome.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2291/2364173105_d5591a86e5_o.gif" alt="domebigpic" height="551" width="400"></p>
<p>And sure, you&#8217;re to read here about all manner of shady and shifty character who occupied 201 South Grand during the Dome’s heyday, but I’ll delight most in telling you of Frank Babcock, one of the Dome’s owners, the man who through the late 1950s took on the Community Redevelopment Agency in lawsuit after lawsuit pointing out, and correctly, that the CRA had no right to condemn the Hill&#8217;s habitable property and certainly not to use public money to do so (Babcock’s theory that oil bigwig/CRA chairman William T. Sesnon Jr. was after Bunker Hill for its oil reserves is a bit fanciful, but is, in fact, backed up by the area’s hydrocarbon geology—but all things in due time).</p>
<p>On the morning  of July 25, 1964, the Dome burst into flame, and as mentioned by Richard <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/Minnewaska" title="minnieburns" target="_blank">here</a>, there’s been some question as to just how and why the Dome, most prominent and distantly visible of the Bunker Hill structures, burned.  While there had been some land purchases and building demolitions, despite the CRA’s inception in 1948, they had by 1964 accomplished very little.  Was the burning of the Dome a &quot;push&quot; in the &quot;right direction&quot;?  (After Mayor Yorty called for an audit of the agency’s redevelopment techniques, it was determined in 1966 that the CRA used shoddy business practices to achieve limited progress, despite simple goals that, according to a report four months in the making, myopically favored bulldozers over rehabilitation and conservation.)<br>

Conspiracies aside, she burns, her cremains removed and scattered to the four winds:<br>
<img loading="lazy" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2291/2370422928_a7bf8ec3a1_o.gif" alt="beingrazed" height="400" width="178"><br>
“&#8230;will give way to a parking lot until the renewal project gets under way.”&#157;  She’s been a parking lot since October 1964:<br>

The Disney Hall and Colburn School (right and bottom) are new additions; on the left is the 1989 Grand Promenade Apartments, which, judging by the <a href="http://www.apartmentratings.com/rate/CA-Los-Angeles-Grand-Promenade-Tower.html" title="lessthangrand" target="_blank">reviews</a>, certainly indicates the CRA did a great job.</p>
<p>Forty-four years as a parking lot but not, perhaps, forever, given this hint from the planning department regarding the tract: <br>

&#8230;and so on.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This is the famous Minnewaska Hotel which sat at the corner of 3rd &amp; Grand.  On July 26th, 1964 fire engulfed the venerable old building, which hosted 63 units.  The open central stairway was blamed on the blaze which spread like a blowtorch, killing one tenant and injuring six others.</p>
<p>Slated for demolition in 1967, it was rumored that the fire was intentionally started to stir up support for quicking the rehabilitation of the hill, which was simply another way of hastening it&#8217;s complete demolition to make way for commercial buildings which fit into the CRA (Community Redevelopment Agency)&#8217;s agenda.</p>
