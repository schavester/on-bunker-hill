Not to mention how the wife keeps sending him out to that sanatorium way the hell and gone in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daggett,_California" title="Daggonit" target="_blank">Daggett</a>, you know, for his <i>health</i>, which finally cost him the aforementioned job at the Dairy Lunch, and though his wife has become the breadwinner as a waitress down there at his old place of employ, she sure has been getting chummy with that oft-lunching Herman Siemers fellow.</p>
<p>Mr. A E. and wife had met Herman J. Siemers at the restaurant, where Herman had lunched daily, and they&#8217;d befriended him, she more than he apparently.  Not that Herman”™s offer to Mrs. Stotts of a moonlight horseback ride wasn”™t innocent; unfortunately, it”™s about the only thing in the world more romantic than consumption.  This apparently riled A. E.</p>
<p>It”™s the Friday afternoon of November 11, 1932, and Mrs. Stotts has gussied herself up in full riding gear for a gallop in Rustic Canyon–Herman Siemers was a member of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rustic_Canyon,_Los_Angeles,_California#History" title="theUL" target="_blank">Uplifter”™s</a> <a href="http://www.inthecanyon.com/history/history/pg3.htm" title="yonhistory" target="_blank">Club</a>,<a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9501EFDB1E3DF93BA25752C0A9679C8B63" title="bastard" target="_blank"> hoo ha</a>! Siemers bounded up the stairs of the Stott”™s Alto Hotel, with all the good health of a man <i>not</i> wasting away from the inside, knocked on the door, and Mrs. Stotts opened.  The two were not aware of the firearm-equipped white-plague addled Mr. Stotts lurking in the dark shadows.<br>
<img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3086/2471711934_033e9cb44e_o.gif" alt="datelinestotts" align="left" height="265" width="267"><br>
Mr. A. E. lept from the depths and fired one shot into her heart.  He turned on Siemers but elected not to keep to his chest shot MO:  though at very close range, one bullet went through the crown of Siemers”™s hat, another grazed his left temple as it tore through the hat brim, another burned a path across his right temple on taking out the hat brim”™s other side.  A fourth bullet struck Siemers in his right leg.</p>
<p>A. E., having done all he could do and with but one bullet left, dashed to the fire escape, smashed the window pane with his revolver, stepped out on the landing, placed the muzzle to his right temple and fired. </p>
<p>Siemers ended up in <a href="http://silverlake.tribe.net/photos/c686a18c-c1aa-4d27-b9bb-d18eb879ea50" title="MSH" target="_blank">Monte Sano</a> hospital with a broken leg, a powder burned face, and an irreparably damaged hat; Mr. and Mrs. Stotts in the grave, and the Alto with a newly vacant apartment.</p>

<p>The demise of Bunker Hill conjures up image of bull dozers doing the bidding of the Community Redevelopment Agency, leveling the landscape of the once colorful and picturesque neighborhood. While the CRA&#8217;s master plan dealt the final blow to Bunker Hill, the demolition of victorian structures in the area had been taking place for decades. The Brunson Mansion at the corner of Fourth Street and Grand Avenue was an imposing structure that seemed destined to stand indefinitely. Instead it would last less than four decades and become an early victim of the City&#8217;s obsession with the automobile. </p>
<p>The residence known as the Brunson Mansion was built in the early 1880s by Judge Anson Brunson who resided on the bench of the Los Angeles County Superior Court before stepping down to serve as a lawyer for the lucrative Santa Fe Rail Road. According to the L.A. Times, the residence was “a dark red house, large, compact, dignified, in the center of sloping lawns walled up above the level of three streets.”&#157; The house was so large it had a Bunker Hill Avenue and a Grand Avenue address, before settling on 347 South Grand as its official label.</p>

</div>
<p>
The Judge resided at the home with his wife Angela until the early 1890s when details of his torrid affair with the widow of a Civil War General came to light. In December 1892, Mrs. Brunson filed for divorce on the grounds of desertion, extreme cruelty and adultery. She was supposedly in possession of hotel registers and love letters, one of which read like “an extract from a French novel,”&#157; documenting the relationship  between her 60 year old husband and Mrs. General George Stoneman, 10 years his junior. The Judge had left the Grand Ave property and taken up residence on Flower Street and Mrs. Brunson stayed in the mansion until she was forced to sell it in 1894. While Judge Brunson denied the existence of a romantic relationship between him and Mrs. Stoneman, when he died in October 1894, he left all his possessions to  “my dear and faithful friend, Mary O.H. Stoneman.”&#157; Years after the mansion was long gone, locals felt that the “ghosts of unhappinesses remained there,”&#157; haunted by “the husband and wife who for years lived as strangers under the same stately roof.”&#157;</p>

<p>One of the mansion&#8217;s next owners was Dr. B.F. Church, who with his wife, used part of the house as their residence where numerous social gatherings were held. The doctor converted the other part of the house into the short-lived Los Angeles Eye, Ear &amp; Throat Hospital aka The Eye and Ear Infirmary until 1901. Eighteen years later, B.F. Church, who had suffered years of mental problems, would throw himself out of an office window at 7th and Grand, plummeting to his death in front of a lunchtime crowd. </p>
<p>In the early years of the new Century, the 18 room property became the Hotel Brunson. Its thirteen years as a boarding house would see little incident other than almost getting burned down by a wayward firecracker in 1904, and the shooting of a burglar by a hotel resident in 1909 (the police followed the trail of blood and apprehended the suspect at his nearby home).</p>

<p>By 1917, the automobile had come to Bunker Hill and the owners of the property at 347 South Grand decided that a two story brick garage would be more lucrative than a hotel. In April of that year, the furnishings of the Brunson Hotel were auctioned off, and stately structure which was once a “show place of the city”&#157; was demolished and replaced by an auto mechanic.</p>

<p>Monday, January 14, 1963</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3005/2438460489_8dc71b93c1_o.gif" alt="jumperlong" align="left" height="896" width="200">Bunker Hill”™s final days, after its Official Designation as blighted slum, evokes not only decrepit dandified buildings like the Dome, but also its downtrodden denizens, shuffling along, infused with all the despair and longing and hopelessness you”™d expect from folks in a blighted slum.  It being Official, after all.  </p>
<p>Victor Palomino, 29, was one such shuffler.  He was another resident of the <a href="/theDome" title="anotherDomer" target="_blank">Dome</a>, who”™d actually been fine and dandy until Friday last when he was canned from his gig as a carpenter at the Civic Center project.  He brooded over the wintry weekend and at mid-afternoon on a jobless Monday, thought to himself as had another of his carpenter brethren, why hast thou forsaken me? and decided to shuffle from the Dome a couple hundred feet to the northeast to the corner of First and Hope.  </p>
<p>There stood the great steel frame of the <a href="http://www.you-are-here.com/los_angeles/dwp.html" title="acmartindwp" target="_blank">Department of Water and Power building</a>.  Like King Kong, frustrated, recently out of a job, though trading Skyscraper Deco for Corporate Modern, Victor climbed fourteen stories of the skeleton and perched on a narrow I-beam 220 feet above the earth.  Would the four children of his pregnant common-law wife Angie, 21, ever see him again?  Would the seven children from his previous wife ever see him again? (Why is it residents of the Dome so like to <a href="/sickmanjumps" title="sickmanjumps" target="_blank">leap</a>?)</p>
<p>For three tense hours he screamed he was going to jump.  Angie and his priest screamed back (presumably for him not to, not “Jump! Jump!”&#157;) but it was Milt Borik, project manager for <a href="http://www.emporis.com/en/cd/cm/?id=gustknewbergconstructionco-chicago-il-usa" title="GKN" target="_blank">Gust K. Newberg</a>, who finally coaxed Victor down with the promise of his job back.</p>
<p>It was a ruse.  After Victor came down, he didn”™t go back to his home in the Dome, with is bays and spindles, its hands at two minutes to midnight, in direct aesthetic if not moral opposition to LA&#8217;s true <a href="http://www.ladwp.com/ladwp/cms/ladwp001562.jsp" title="mulfalls" target="_blank">Mulholland Fountain</a>, no; Victor”™s in Central Receiving under psych-ob, and he”™ll be there for a little while.<br>

<p>Old Bunker Hill can evoke images of Victorian grander and prosperity, as well as faded glory and great loss. While many associate the history of Bunker Hill with the buildings that once decorated the landscape, the riches to rags stories of the neighborhood also belong to many of its inhabitants. The Rose Mansion at Fourth Street and Grand Avenue was once one of the most picturesque homes on the Hill and its builder and namesake a highly regarded pioneer of Los Angeles County.  Despite a celebrated beginning, the house would be demolished long before the Community Redevelopment Agency (CRA) razed the neighborhood, and its original owner would meet his end in a most macabre manner.</p>
<div style="text-align: center">
</div>
<p>Leonard John Rose (L.J.), was a native of Bavaria who immigrated to New Orleans when he was twelve. He received  an education in Illinois and engaged in early business ventures in Iowa before organizing a party, including his wife Amanda and two children, to travel to California in 1857. After crossing the Colorado River, the group was attacked by a Native American tribe, incurring losses of life and supplies. Rose and his family survived and temporarily settled in New Mexico. The family made it to California in 1860 and established themselves in the San Gabriel Valley.</p>

</div>
<div style="text-align: center">
<i>Sunny Slope Ranch</i> 
</div>
<p>Sunny Slope was the name of the renowned ranch Rose acquired shortly after arriving in Southern California. Located in what is now the eastern end of Pasadena, the 1,900 acre property contained countess lemon, orange and olive trees, but became famous for its vineyards.  Vines were imported from Spain, Italy and Peru, and the wine and brandy generated from Sunny Slope made L.J. Rose a household name and a very wealthy man. He also found success as a breeder with a horse ranch named Rosemead (where the city of the same name now stands), and eventually became a State Senator.</p>
<div align="center">

</div>
<p>In 1887, the somewhat secluded neighborhood of Bunker Hill attracted Rose, and he purchased land at the corner of Fourth and Grand (then called Charity) to build a palatial home for his family that now included nine children. Construction on the house was such a massive undertaking that a scathing editorial appeared in the Los Angeles Times criticizing the builders for piling up so much lumber in the streets that carriages could not pass through.</p>
<p>Designed by architects Curlett &amp; Eissen at a cost of around $50,000 and completed in 1888, the Rose Mansion was a gleaming gem among the jewels of Bunker Hill. The L.A. Times ran a piece dedicated solely to the stained glass widows, designed by Rose&#8217;s son <a href="http://www.guyrose.com/" title="Guy Rose Art" target="_blank">Guy</a>, who would become a respected Impressionist painter. The Los Angeles Evening Express was so impressed with the stately structure that an extensive article appeared in 1890 describing the interior whose “first and second floors are finished in hard woods and the third in white cedar.”&#157; The dining room had a “heavily paneled ceiling”&#157; and a bay window with an “elaborately carved arch of oak supported by dragons.”&#157; A “heavily carved giant staircase”&#157; ran through the house and frescoes by [Attilio] Moretti of San Francisco adorned the ceilings. The home also included a plush library and music room, but the most talked about part of the house was the wine cellar where Rose stored an impressive selection of wines and spirits. On the outside, the most distinct feature of the property was the granite retaining wall surrounding the house with polished steps leading up to the entry.</p>
<div align="center">

</div>
<p>Despite his tremendous success, by 1899 bad investments had left Rose deeply in debt with properties so heavily mortgaged that selling them would have been fruitless. On May 17, a despondent Rose told his wife he was going to Ventura on business and would be returning the next day. Instead, he returned to Los Angeles that night and drafted a suicide note addressed to the his wife at the Mansion, and mailed it. At 10 o&#8217;clock the next morning, Mrs. Rose received the letter with Rose stating financial ruin as the reason for taking his own life. He continued the letter by bidding an affectionate farewell to his family.</p>
<p>Also included was a postscript stating that his body could be found in the backyard of the Mansion.</p>
<p>Family present at the time “were too overwhelmed with apprehension to go to the yard to see whether his dead body was really there.”&#157; Mrs. Rose&#8217;s son-in-law was summoned from his office Downtown and upon arrival found “his father-in-law lying face downward in a little hollow at the rear of the lot. His head reclined on his hat, and in one hand was clasped a bunch of carnations.”&#157; Miraculously, Rose was still alive and was taken to a hospital where his stomach was pumped to remove the 65 morphine pills he had swallowed. Despite the efforts to save his life, too much of the drug had been absorbed into his system and Leonard John Rose died at the age of 72. The official cause of death was morphine poisoning.</p>

<p>
L.J. Rose was heavily eulogized by the county he had called home for nearly 40 years and the “courageous pioneer”&#157; was laid to rest in Evergreen Cemetery. In the meantime, his wife Amanda was left with a ruined empire and the Mansion was soon lost to foreclosure. After a mere 11 years, the Roses no longer reigned over the house at Fourth and Grand.</p>

</div>
<p>The Rose Mansion was briefly occupied by real estate investor Albert W. McCready. In 1903 the residence was purchased by Colonel Albert B. Hotchkiss, creator and editor of the local publication Public Economy, with his wife Mary. <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=%22hotchkiss+park%22&amp;near=Santa+Monica,+CA&amp;fb=1&amp;cid=34006532,-118484103,11423716760271147898&amp;li=lmd&amp;z=14&amp;t=m" title="Hotchkiss Park" target="_blank">Mrs. Hotchkiss</a> , one of the few women in early Los Angeles to make a name for herself in real estate. A colorful character, Mary Hotchkiss at one time owned a large chunk of Main Street and was once accused of abducting a neighbor&#8217;s parrot named “Dude.”&#157; Colonel Hotchkiss  died of natural causes inside the mansion and Mary wasted no time in landing husband #3, Dr. J.T. Jauch.</p>

<p>The Jauches resided at the former Rose Mansion until 1928, when they took up permanent residence at the Fremont Hotel on Fourth and Olive, which Mary owned. The building appears to have remained vacant and in 1935 the State Emergency Relief Administration (SERA) proposed using the residence to house transients. The Health Commission turned this idea down.</p>

<p>By 1937 the Rose Mansion was supposedly in such disrepair that it was no longer inhabitable. In the biography L.J. Rose of Sunny Slope, the pioneer&#8217;s son claims that the heavy wood paneling was salvaged by 20th Century Fox and used to decorate sets on the Alice Faye/Tyrone Power feature In Old Chicago. When the CRA began its invasion of Bunker Hill in the 1950s, all that remained was the garage and the ghosts of the Rose Mansion and its owners.</p>

<p>Having described the <a href="/theDome" title="dadome" target="_blank">Dome</a> to you in some detail, we figured it would be in the interest of OBH readers to be kept <a href="/DomeDenizenSmith" title="bgirl" target="_blank">abreast</a> of the hotel”™s <a href="/sickmanjumps" title="jumper" target="_blank">tenants</a>.  Enter Carl F. Brannon.</p>
<p>Carl called 201 South Grand home.  He worked down at the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/79761301@N00/2378839160/" title="gowayne" target="_blank">Simon”™s Drive-In</a> at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=S+Figueroa+St+%26+Exposition+Blvd,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90007&amp;jsv=107&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=68.98527,108.984375&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=34.019034,-118.282413&amp;spn=0.009035,0.013304&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr" title="simonize" target="_blank">3607 South Figueroa,</a> as manager no less.  A man of quality.  And bravery, to take on such a dangerous job.</p>

<p>Detective Sgts. Lambert and Thedens of Univeristy Division quizzed him all about the incident, and that fishy smell, the one that didn”™t emanate from Simon”™s deep-fryer.  Police Forensic Chemist Ray Pinker gave Brannon”™s superficial wounds a look-see, and let”™s face it, it”™s <i>hard</i> to slash yourself.  </p>
<p>Turns out Brannon had lost heavily in the Vegas gambling houses (running afoul of the El Rancho, Last Frontier, and Benji Siegel”™s newly opened Flamingo, no doubt) and took the money to make good on his losses.  $861 was found in a crock in Simon”™s storeroom.  </p>
<p>Brannon”™ll spend a little time in stir before he slinks his sad-slashed self back to the Dome.</p>

Date: June 9, 1931</p>
<p>Richard Veit, mechanic, resident of the Minnewaska, aged 67 (or so it appears, through the blotchy ink of the news clipping), took his life today by leaping from the eastern end of the Second Avenue tunnel. He was gravely injured, but managed to tell detectives he had been chronically ill for many years and wanted to die, which he soon did after arrival at Georgia Street Receiving Hospital. He left a note to a Mrs. F.A. Schofield in Chicago directing her to dispose of his property there.</p>

		<p>July 14, 1949</p>
<p>Grace E. Smith made the Dome her home.  From there she made the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=1069071389578867972,34.052220,-118.250030&amp;saddr=201+S+Grand+Ave,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90012&amp;daddr=426+S+Hill+St,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90013&amp;sll=34.052197,-118.251858&amp;sspn=0.009031,0.015814&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=34.052144,-118.252115&amp;spn=0.009031,0.015814&amp;z=16" title="roundaboutway" target="_blank">trek to work</a> down to the Belmont Grill.  It”™s 1949.  She”™s a B-girl.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2010/2362641520_02d623eb9d_o.gif" alt="domeup2ndfromolive" height="350" width="500"></p>
<p>Vice has been coming down on prosties of late and joints like the Belmont that run B-girl operations are a thorn in the side of decent society.  The racket is simple:  the gals chat up the fellas, and as a gal mingles with the patrons she induces them to buy more drinks.  Her bourbons are colored water or ice tea; she gets a commission of those sales.  And if she takes off with her new friend, we”™ll call him, oh, John, the tavern owner gets a cut of her earnings.  Repeat.  </p>
<p>After a while Vice gets tired of dealing with pimp beat downs, or customers given the mick finn, so it”™s time to round up the ladies.  Grace E. Smith, 28, won”™t get to go home to her little room at the Dome tonight, popped as she was at the Belmont for violating the municipal B-girl ordinance.  Tomorrow morning she”™ll be out on $100 bail.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2379/2362444800_a5d3bd974c_o.gif" alt="b-elmont" height="416" width="500"></p>
<p>Grace&#8217;s boss Nathan Bass, owner of the Belmont, has been supbeanoed to testify before the county grand jury in its current vice inquiry into the <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,853775,00.html" title="allentown" target="_blank">Brenda Allen</a> police pay-off probe.  (Bass had been in the news last month when he, as a pal of LAPD Lieutenant Wellpott, had wiretaps of his phone calls played at the PD/Allen vice hearings.)  Bass went on to testify that famously dirty Sgts. Stoker and Jackson would meet in the Belmont. </p>
<p>The next mention of Grace E. Smith–one wonders if it&#8217;s she and the same–is in 1953:  a Lena S. Reed, 72, was to leave her $8,000 estate ($61,857 USD 2007) to her family but just before her demise opted to bequeath it to Mrs. Edna W. “Mail Fraud”&#157; Ballard (aka St. Germain, aka Joan of Arc, aka Lotus Ray King), cofounder of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22I_AM%22_Activity" title="ImNot" target="_blank">I AM</a> religious movement.  A judge blocked probate when the family filed contest, accusing Mrs. Ballard of “exerting undue influence on Mrs. Reed while she was in ill health and mentally disturbed.”&#157;  The same accusations were made against the secretary of the organization”™s St. Germain Foundation, and executor of the will, one Grace E. Smith.</p>
<p>No mention as to whether this Grace E. Smith lived in the Dome.</p>

		<p>The Minnewaska, aka The Dome, played host to no small quantity of characters over the course of her life.  Over the course of this blog you”™ll be introduced to your fair share of them.  Here then is a brief introduction to this, their home.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2383/2363258642_cce2deb895_o.gif" alt="minnie1903" height="488" width="550"></p>
<p>Our first mention of the Minnewaska comes in the form of this notice regarding building permits, January 11, 1903:<br>
<img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3077/2363363716_11d9d7833d_o.jpg" alt="minniebldngpermit" align="middle" height="122" width="261"><br>
She is completed within the year and on December 20 described in the <i>Times</i> thusly:</p>
<div align="justify">
”¦recently completed by J M Shield on the southwest corner of Grand avenue and Second street”¦the location, only three blocks from Broadway and Second street, and near the highest point of Olive Heights, is one which is both desirable and commanding.<br>
The house is a four-story combination frame and cement structure with tower.<br>
Its foundation is a heavy brick wall imbedded in solid red gravel.  Very heavy dimension timbers were used as the owner contemplated adding two or more stories to the building at some time in the future.  The outer walls are covered with heavy diagonals and on this surface is placed steel lath and two coats of cement plaster.  The latter is tinted a delicate cream color, which gives the building a very pleasing exterior.
</div>
<div align="justify">
The interior is arranged in flats of two and four rooms each, which are supplied with private baths, marble-topped wash stands, electric bells, steam heat, and such other modern conveniences as are usually found in the best apartment hotels.<br>
The house contains 122 guests”™ rooms and thirty-seven bathrooms, besides dining-room, kitchen, storeroom, cold-storage and furnace rooms, office and reception-room.  The latter are finished in paneled oak and have decorated ceilings.<br>
The apartments are finished in white cedar, and are so arranged that each room can be entered from a hall.  The building could therefore be easily converted into a regular commercial hotel.<br>
Its main hall is arranged as an open court, and its roof garden affords a view of the surrounding country that extends from the mountains to the sea.<br>
The building cost about $65,000.  The lot on which it stands extends westward to Bunker Hill avenue and affords space for an extension to the present building that would give it a frontage of about 400 feet on the three streets and a total of 200 guests”™ rooms.
</div>
<p>Sold in 1905, the Minnewaska remains so named in the city directories until 1907, when she becomes, simply and more descriptively, the Dome.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2291/2364173105_d5591a86e5_o.gif" alt="domebigpic" height="551" width="400"></p>
<p>And sure, you&#8217;re to read here about all manner of shady and shifty character who occupied 201 South Grand during the Dome”™s heyday, but I”™ll delight most in telling you of Frank Babcock, one of the Dome”™s owners, the man who through the late 1950s took on the Community Redevelopment Agency in lawsuit after lawsuit pointing out, and correctly, that the CRA had no right to condemn the Hill&#8217;s habitable property and certainly not to use public money to do so (Babcock”™s theory that oil bigwig/CRA chairman William T. Sesnon Jr. was after Bunker Hill for its oil reserves is a bit fanciful, but is, in fact, backed up by the area”™s hydrocarbon geology–but all things in due time).</p>
<p>On the morning  of July 25, 1964, the Dome burst into flame, and as mentioned by Richard <a href="/Minnewaska" title="minnieburns" target="_blank">here</a>, there”™s been some question as to just how and why the Dome, most prominent and distantly visible of the Bunker Hill structures, burned.  While there had been some land purchases and building demolitions, despite the CRA”™s inception in 1948, they had by 1964 accomplished very little.  Was the burning of the Dome a &quot;push&quot; in the &quot;right direction&quot;?  (After Mayor Yorty called for an audit of the agency”™s redevelopment techniques, it was determined in 1966 that the CRA used shoddy business practices to achieve limited progress, despite simple goals that, according to a report four months in the making, myopically favored bulldozers over rehabilitation and conservation.)<br>

Conspiracies aside, she burns, her cremains removed and scattered to the four winds:<br>
<img loading="lazy" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2291/2370422928_a7bf8ec3a1_o.gif" alt="beingrazed" height="400" width="178"><br>
“&#8230;will give way to a parking lot until the renewal project gets under way.”&#157;  She”™s been a parking lot since October 1964:<br>

The Disney Hall and Colburn School (right and bottom) are new additions; on the left is the 1989 Grand Promenade Apartments, which, judging by the <a href="http://www.apartmentratings.com/rate/CA-Los-Angeles-Grand-Promenade-Tower.html" title="lessthangrand" target="_blank">reviews</a>, certainly indicates the CRA did a great job.</p>
<p>Forty-four years as a parking lot but not, perhaps, forever, given this hint from the planning department regarding the tract: <br>

		<p>This is the famous Minnewaska Hotel which sat at the corner of 3rd &amp; Grand.  On July 26th, 1964 fire engulfed the venerable old building, which hosted 63 units.  The open central stairway was blamed on the blaze which spread like a blowtorch, killing one tenant and injuring six others.</p>
<p>Slated for demolition in 1967, it was rumored that the fire was intentionally started to stir up support for quicking the rehabilitation of the hill, which was simply another way of hastening it&#8217;s complete demolition to make way for commercial buildings which fit into the CRA (Community Redevelopment Agency)&#8217;s agenda.</p>
