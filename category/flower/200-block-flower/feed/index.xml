Thomas Major Jr., 34, a logger by profession, down from Vancouver to take in the town.  He was in the barroom at the Rollin Hotel, Third and Flower, when the cops came in to investigate a brawl, January 24, 1960.  They have a funny way of doing things up in British Columbia, apparently, for as the bulls were bracing some other bar patron, Major pulled out a gun, pointed it at the cops”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> backs, and began pulling the trigger.  The cops heard the click-click of two empty chambers, turned, and fired seven shots at Major.</p>
<p>Major was hit seven times, taking four in the abdomen.  Detectives Pailing and Buckland, with Municipal Judge Griffith in tow, made a visit to Major”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s bed in the prison ward at General Hospital, where they charged him with two counts of assault with intent to commit murder and one of violating the deadly weapons control law.</p>
<p>The GH docs had pulled all sorts of lead from Major, but there was still the matter of the bullet in Major”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s <i>heart</i>.  Yes, normally a slug from a Parker-issued K-38 in the ticker is going to put you down for good.  But this one found its place there in an unsual way; one of those bullets to the abdomen apparently passed through the liver, entered a large vein and was pumped into the upper right chamber of the heart, passed through the valve to the lower left chamber, an in that ventricle there it sat.  Apparently you can”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t just leave well enough alone, so someone had to go in and get the damn thing.</p>
<p>Enter Drs. <a href="https://ats.ctsnetjournals.org/cgi/content/full/66/6/2132" title="lymanplace" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lyman Brewer</a> and Ellsworth Wareham, of the <a href="https://www.whitememorial.com/about/history/index.php" title="CME" target="_blank" rel="noopener">College of Medical Evangelists</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>May 6, 1915.  Mr. H. J. Robinson, of 210 South Flower, met long-time acquaintance Ernest Lightfoot at another house Robinson owned at 121 South Flower.  While the two were inspecting 121–Lightfoot had proposed Robinson trade him the house for some land in the Imperial Valley–Lightfoot slugged the elderly Robinson, knocking him unconscious.  </p>
<p>Robinson recovered consciousness enough to feel someone tugging at his diamond ring–which he”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />d never been able to get off himself, though Lightfoot was able to do enough of a number on Robinson”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s finger to effect removal.</p>
<p>While Robinson recovered in Westlake Hospital, suffering contusions of the head and a concussion of the brain (and a bruised finger), Lightfoot was picked up by detectives.  Turns out this Lightfoot was the same charmer who in 1910 was charged with rape and given five years probation, and who in 1914 was arrested for child abandonment.</p>

<p>Yes, 210 South Flower, which we know as the Stanley Apartments, as pictured <a href="/node/157" title="youknowforrobbers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> and <a href="/TheMarcella" title="andinthecomments" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

For the article they dug up one of the original uprooted persons, a Jim Dorr, 73, who”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />d been sent a notice by the CRA to vacate the Stanley Apartments on November 15, 1965.

<p>Sez Jim:</p>
<p>“I”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />ve been around Bunker Hill off and on now for forty or fifty years.  They say it was nice once.  But they let it run down for years.  The Stanley was a very old place, well kept, but they didn”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t spend much money on it.”</p>
<p>(Just for the record, despite what it says in the caption at right, the Bunker Hill Towers are not on the spot of the Stanley.  The Stanley is at the red hatched box below; Dorr&#8217;s standing at the blue dot.)</p>

<p>Looking down 2nd toward Hope.  (Needless to say, Bunker Hill Avenue has removed itself from the equation.)  (But then, so has pretty much everything else.)</p>

<p>Harold J. McAnally of 230 South Flower (the <a href="/vanfleet" title="vanfleet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Van Fleet Apartments</a>) tried to buy a drink for a woman in the bar, when he was pushed from his barstool by a jealous rival.  McAnally fell, cracking his head on the bar&#8217;s concrete floor and fracturing his skull.  As you can see in the picture here, though McAnally is lying prone on the ground, no one seems to be all that concerned.  Perhaps the regulars were callous, or didn&#8217;t care for him, but it&#8217;s also possible that McAnally was already dead, and nothing was left to be done.</p>
<p>He arrived DOA at the Georgia Receiving Hospital, and shortly thereafter, Frank Swope, 33, turned himself in to the police, confessing that he was the one who had shoved McAnally at the bar.  Swope hadn&#8217;t meant to hurt him; he was just angry about McAnally&#8217;s flirtation.</p>

Emma thereupon took John shopping”¦as far from Denver as she could get, and with as great a chance of disappearing as possible.  Because clichÃ©s are born of truth, noir clichÃ©s especially, she beelined straight for Los Angeles, Bunker Hill specifically, and checked into the St. Regis.</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3219/2766223037_04a8b1ba4e_o.gif" alt="EmmaAndSon" height="500" width="446" /></p>
<p>
For ten weeks the FBI combed the States until they were tipped off by an acquaintance of Emma”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s, and on September 19 the Feds descended on 237 South Flower.  Emma, 30, was pulled from the St. Regis hysterical and weeping; the boy, whom she called “Jackie,” appeared impassive.  Emma Rupe broke down again when a Denver jury gave her twenty to life.</p>

Much in the way a French Renaissance building might be dubbed the Sherwood, this Missionesque structure is named after a French nobleman–<a href="https://content.stregis.org/parish/templates/info.aspx?articleid=892&amp;zoneid=73" title="theReg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">J. F. Regis</a>, tireless converter of Huguenots, and advocate of lacemaking for wayward girls.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The St. Regis leads a fairly quiet life.  Other than the aforementioned FBI intrusion in 1936, there was the small matter of the coppers showing up to collect Elmer Hudson, 32, and his wife Betty, 20, in 1928.  When two bad guys held up a cafÃ© at <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=200+N+Dillon+St,+Los+Angeles,+Los+Angeles,+California+90057,+United+States&amp;sll=34.075039,-118.283315&amp;sspn=0.008727,0.013819&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;cd=1&amp;layer=c&amp;ll=34.078096,-118.281426&amp;spn=0.008726,0.013819&amp;z=16&amp;cbll=34.07374,-118.28216&amp;panoid=S1CP8ye7XYSpRibTsQ-_iQ" title="wink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">200 Dillon Street</a> and made off with $300 ($3,554 USD2007), Betty made the mistake of not keeping her bad-guy self in the shadows.  CafÃ© owner C. V. Anderson recognized her as a former waitress.</p>
<p>What is it about these wayward gals–waitresses both–that can”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t keep their clutchy paws off money nor baby?  Maybe they”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />ll learn some lacemaking in the pen.  Make St. Regis proud.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3167/2766302079_9e8d622313_o.gif" alt="fireforcesflee" align="left" height="88" width="183" />The early 1960s were no more kind to this little niche of the Hill than any other.  The Bozwell Apartments (which seem to shoot for Greek Revival but, oddly, come off as Monterrey) next door at 245, abandoned, burn on May 22, 1962.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3050/2766358639_4947e4869e_o.gif" alt="boznotwell" height="318" width="351" /></p>

<p>The blaze, reported the Times, was believed to have been “touched off by hobos.”</p>
<p>While firemen kept the conflagration from spreading to the St. Regis, its days were just as numbered as if it were the Bozwell itself.</p>
<p>For these were heady days:  the Lesser Festivals of Abandoment, The Princial Feasts of Official Neglect, and the Commemorations of Escalating Mysterious Fires.  Obligatory for the observant.</p>

Holland states he”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s looking at $3,000 ($65,983 USD2007) in damages, $2,000 to the rugs and furniture alone.  <br />

It is reported that a man was seen running from the building a few minutes before the fire broke out.  The storeroom, where the fire began, was not locked.  The mystery is never solved but Marcella, stout of bay and stalwart of column, cannot be burned away.  She perseveres.<br />

<p>The Marcella is a building so lovely she attracts only the comeliest of patrons.  She is home to Miss May Long, a lass so fetching that when in May of 1913 she turned her attentions to one Earl G. Horton, he is gunned down by another suitor outside of his apartment house near <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=1129+W+Temple+St,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90012&amp;sll=34.068214,-118.251193&amp;sspn=0.00855,0.013304&amp;layer=c&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=34.067841,-118.251235&amp;spn=0.00855,0.013304&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr&amp;cbll=34.063953,-118.25192&amp;panoid=GHaKiWGCNCAnGNrIWbCV1Q" title="shooting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Temple &amp; Victor</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jealousy over a woman causes upset <i>again</i> at the Marcella on October 25 of 1922 when Emergency Patrolman Claude Coffrin went to visit Mrs. Tillie Smith in her Marcella apartment.  Not long after Coffrin&#8217;s ingress, there appeared Emergency Patrolman Anthony Kazokas and a civilian, Joe Cummins.  Kazokas had loaned Cummins his revolver and badge to settle his romantic score with Coffrin over Tillie.</p>

<p>Coffrin and Cummins fought, and Coffrin gained control of the gun; he phoned the Detective Bureau and over came officers Nickens and Ellis.  Cummins at that point grabbed the gun back from Coffrin and stuck it in Nickens”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> side, and Patrolman Kazokas jumped on Detective Ellis.  Ellis brained Kazokas out cold with the butt of his gun, but Nickens ended up shooting Cummins through the neck.  </p>
<p>The lovely Mrs. Smith was arrested on violation of parole; she had been sentenced on the 18th to pay $50 and spend thirty days in jail–suspended–for “social vagrancy”.  Apparently, quality of young lady was beginning to decline at the Marcella.<br />

Other upstanding members of society to grace the Marcella”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s rooms were the Jacksons, of whom you read all about <a href="/node/118" title="NISA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. <br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And remember <a href="/iwantolive" title="idont" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Barbara Graham</a>?  What helped send Barbara to the chair was hubby Henry”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s testimony on the witness stand.  Her last-ditch alibi was that she and Henry were together that night of March 9, 1953–but Henry testified he had already moved out and was living with his mother”¦at the Marcella.  (A mere two blocks down from the Lancaster, scene of Baxter Shorter&#8217;s abduction.)</p>
<p>Little Tommy Graham, now five, was living in the Marcella in 1957 when Wanger Pictures gave him $1000 for filming his executed mother”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s life story.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fire again struck the Marcella, this time in 1962, and this time it meant business.  On March 30 a blaze razed the upper two stories of the structure.  Twelve fire units quelled the blaze in half an hour; She of 223 South Flower vanished from memory soon afterward.</p>
<p>Here we are looking north on Flower through the intersection of Third, 1965.  See the little Victorian, left center?  The Marcella was just on the other side of that.<br />

Today Flower Street makes a sharp turn between Third and Second to avoid the Bunker Hill Towers.  The Marcella stood just on the other side of this pool:</p>

<p>Interesting, and, what, perhaps a little unnerving, but certainly instructive, to consider that the image that began this post, and the one immediately above, were taken from the same spot.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here was the Van Fleet, a three-story frame apartment house built in 1911 by Garrett &amp; Bixby for citrus man Nelson Van Fleet. The 29 apartments were split between two- and three-room models, and it was in one of them on March 22, 1912, that Marie Higginson, 40-ish &quot;and quite prepossessing,&quot; having failed to shoot herself in San Pedro last week, gassed herself in the kitchen. Her groans alerted Mrs. Francis Passmore across the hall. Found unconscious on a blanket on the kitchen floor with the oven door removed,  Marie&#8217;s purse revealed the gun and a copy of Walter Malone&#8217;s poem <a href="https://www.poetry-archive.com/m/opportunity.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&quot;Opportunity&quot;</a>–a popular verse among self annihilators, for Joseph N. Vincent recently blew his brains out on Silverwood Hill with the last stanzas in his pocket.</p>
<p>Marie, though, did not die, and on awakening, confessed that in San Pedro her hand had shaken so that she had missed her mark. &quot;I didn&#8217;t shoot a second time because I feared I might not hit a vital spot and would die a lingering death.&quot; The cause of it all was her unhappiness with the mining man who was her companion, so she was trying to remove herself from the equation while he was away in Maricopa. Her miner returned to news that Marie was going before the lunacy commission, but we do not know how she fared there.</p>
<p>An L.A. Times article surveying the freakishly high cost of rents (up as much as 400% in four years) and the difficulty in finding a place that would accept children noted that a two-room apartment with a bath and kitchenette at the Van Fleet would set you back $75 a month in October 1920.</p>
<p>On New Years Eve 1932, 28-year-old entertainer Matthew Tormino left his apartment at the Van Fleet for a booking at the Verdugo Trout Club Lodge in Verdugo Hills. At some point while Tormino, James W. Curtis and Inez Stewart were amusing the guests, a large man became incensed and the talent made a dash for the door. Tormino was the last one out, and took a bullet to the hip. When questioned by police, all anyone could say was that the shooter was &quot;a big guy.&quot; Tormino was expected to recover, but we suggest he work on his act.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3249/2488212421_f183804f81.jpg" alt="spiritualists" height="156" width="376" /></p>
<p>On October 16, 1924, <i>Los Angeles Times</i> reporter Charles Sloan took rooms at the Alexandria Hotel under the name of Dr. Chamberlyn Snow, and arranged a meeting with William A. Jackson, President of the National Independent Spiritualist Association, Inc. (NISA).</p>
<p>He wanted to set up practice as a spiritualist and medium in Los Angeles, he told Jackson, but was unable to get a permit under the city&#8217;s ordinances regulating the operation and advertisement of spiritualist practice.  That license would require that &quot;Snow&quot; be ordained by a recognized spiritualist organization, and the problem was, he told Jackson, &quot;I don&#8217;t know a damn thing about spiritualism.&quot;</p>
<p>This was, Jackson said, no problem at all.  All Snow needed to do was to produce a check for $175, and he could be ordained as a spiritualist minister and healer.  Snow gave his money to Jackson&#8217;s wife, Lois A. Jackson, secretary of N.I.S.A., and all was in order.</p>
<p>On November 7, 1924, acting on Sloan&#8217;s information, warrants were issued for the arrest of the Jacksons, the 8 other directors and officers of NISA, and 36 mediums and spiritualists in Los Angeles, on charges of criminal conspiracy, attempts to obtain money by false pretense, larceny by trick and device, and other related charges.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2134/2489029300_f6fa7c4966_m.jpg" alt="lankershim building" align="left" height="240" width="204" /> The NISA headquarters were located in the Lankershim Building at 3rd and Spring, and many of those arrested lived right on Bunker Hill.</p>
<p>Besides the Jacksons, who resided at 223 S. Flower Street, were Professor Bernard of 316 1/2 S. Broadway, Mabel Tyler of 318 W. 3rd Street, and Michael Crespo, BS, MS, and PhD, the so-called &quot;miracle man,&quot; who lived at 145 S. Spring.</p>
<p>The bust led to an investigation of over 200 spiritualist groups, 48 of them located in Los Angeles.  The cities of Alhambra and Long Beach set about passing ordinances that would make the practice of spiritualism illegal.</p>
<p>Crespo was the easiest target and first major conviction of the bunch, found in violation of the State Medical Practice Act, and guilty of performing illegal marriages and divorces.</p>
<p>NISA records revealed that the organization boasted a membership of over 235,000 people, and held property valued at $112,000; more importantly, they had ordained approximately 5500 people.  In many cases, they had not followed the organization&#8217;s rules that those ordained would have to &quot;demonstrate the gospel, philosophy, and science of continued existence after so-called death according to some commonly accepted or approved methods of the NISA.&quot;</p>
<p>On February 26, 1925, the Jacksons were found guilty of issuing certificates to unqualified persons, allowing them to circumvent city ordinances regulating the practice of spiritualism.  William was sentenced to 90 days in prison and a $500 fine, and Lois to 30 days in prison and a $250 fine.</p>
<p>City Prosecutor Friedlander said of the proceedings, &quot;If this prosecution&#8230; has done nothing else, it has at least stripped the highly colorful veneer of an organized group of religious imposters who were preying upon a class of credulous, superstitious, and unthinking people and brought to the surface a detailed and elaborate method of fraud.&quot;</p>
<p>When NISA&#8217;s charter was revoked by the state on December 2, 1925, Harry Houdini wired his congratulations to the staff of the Times, saying &quot;It was well done.  You have thrown an obstacle in the path of fraudulent spiritualism which will last for years to come.&quot;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Date:  July 3, 1904 <br />
Location:  200 Block of Flower Street</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3222/2470089966_42a72475e3_m.jpg" width="240" height="57" align="left" alt="susie1" />15-year-old Susie Miller was a pretty brunette with a vivacious disposition who loved to play the violin.  She also loved Willie Miller, a 15-year-old butcher&#8217;s apprentice, and he loved her &#8212; the two were already talking about marriage.  But Susie&#8217;s parents, Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Miller disapproved of the match so strongly that they uprooted the family from their home in San Francisco and moved to Los Angeles in the hopes of squashing the love affair.</p>
<p>The family settled in at a pretty little yellow bungalow on the southwest corner of Flower and Second, and Susie&#8217;s brothers quickly found work &#8212; although the <i>Times</i> was quick to point out that they only took jobs to occupy their time, not because they needed the money.  Samuel Miller was somehow affiliated with the streetcar business in San Francisco and described as &quot;a man in good circumstances.&quot;  Even little Susie got in on the fun, taking a job as an operator at the Home Telephone Company, just down the street.</p>
<p>And then, on the morning of July 3, 1904, Susie Miller disappeared.</p>
<p>She told her mother that she&#8217;d asked to work the 6 a.m. shift at the telephone office in order to have the 4th of July off, and left home at 5:30 that morning.  However, when Susie didn&#8217;t come home for lunch, Mrs. Miller began to worry.  She called the telephone office and was informed that Susie had, in fact, tendered her resignation on June 28, and that there was no 6 a.m. Sunday shift.  The family began to panic, and called police to report her missing.  However, they just as quickly lied and told the police that she&#8217;d returned home, not wanting the story to be reported in the paper.</p>
<p>By July 5, there was still no word from Susie, and they decided to come clean.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2119/2470090000_273e5191cd_m.jpg" width="240" height="142" align="right" alt="susie2" /><br />
Yes, there was Willie in San Francisco, but Susie also had another beau in the wings, a man named Harry, last name unknown.  Mrs. Miller said, &quot;Susie met him over the telephone in conversation to begin with and afterwards saw him and told me he was an awfully pretty boy and that she could almost love him.&quot;  All they knew about Harry was that he claimed to be from San Diego, and that his father owned a gold mine.  Their suspicions were heightened when Willie sent a telegram from San Francisco saying he had not seen Susie.</p>
<p>Millie Leach, one of Susie&#8217;s co-workers at the Home Telephone Company, told police that she&#8217;d accompanied Susie to the train station that Sunday morning.  Susie told her she was going to San Diego, but when she purchased her ticket, Millie swore she heard her say, &quot;Frisco.&quot;</p>
<p>So, where was she?  Had she run off with the derelict son of a gold miner, eloped with her hometown sweetheart, or fallen prey to a worse fate?</p>
<p>The <i>Times</i> wrote, &quot;The scheming of a Sherlock Holmes could not have more successfully covered her tracks.&quot;</p>
<p>But where police and reporters alike were stumped, Susie&#8217;s family rose to the occasion and worked to track her down.  Samuel Miller went to San Francisco, and submitted young Willie to some hard questioning, during which the boy cracked.  Susie had gone to a San Francisco hotel owned by her aunt, a woman with whom the family did not keep in touch.  Once she heard her father was on the way, she crossed the bay to stay at the home of another aunt in Vallejo.</p>
<p>After being recovered and returned safely home to Los Angeles, Susie explained herself saying that she meant to write home, but after taking off, it seemed like &quot;a good joke&quot; to let her family wonder where she was.  Then, once the police got involved, she was too scared to tell them where she was.  Outsmarting the LAPD is one thing, but dear old dad is quite another.</p>
