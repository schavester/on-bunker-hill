Martin wasnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t worried â€“ he was convinced that with his charm and wit he would completely annihilate the case against him. When he took the witness stand, Weiss swore a solemn oath that the boys who had been accused of gambling in his saloon had never done any such thing.
