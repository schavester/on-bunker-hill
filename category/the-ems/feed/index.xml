<p>In what will surely go down as the smarmiest piece of journalism in history, the <i>Times</i> recounts the travails of Toy Lane, dancer at the Chinese Junk, 733 North Main. She <a title="thereabouts" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;source=s_d&amp;saddr=321+S+Olive+St,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90013&amp;daddr=733+N+Main+St,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90012&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;mra=ls&amp;sll=34.056588,-118.239412&amp;sspn=0.008266,0.013819&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=34.057886,-118.240378&amp;spn=0.008266,0.013819&amp;t=h&amp;z=16" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">made her way over</a> to the Junk from her pad at The Ems to shimmy for shekels on September 25, 1946. When she gets into the nightclub dressing room to “dress” for her act (the <i>Times</i>‘s flippant application of quotation marks, not mine) she discovers her wardrobe has been stolen: G-string No. 1 (black and orange, beaded,) $35; G-string No. 2 (silver metallic cloth,) $23; beaded shaker, $20; rhinestone brassiere $20; an anklet and armband set, $25.</p>
<p>Miss Lane, it was reported, was mortified–she had to dance with her clothes on!</p>
<p>In a final piece of facetiousness, the <i>Times</i> noted “the police were searching for the burglars and the large van they must have used to carry away the loot.”</p>
<p>The Chinese Junk CafÃ©:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3524/3285317465_7e0520d135_o.gif" alt="wheretogetjunk" width="575" height="373" /></p>
<p>Which was up in China City, a 1935 Chinesque development that predated New Chinatown, and had been the baby of wealthy socialite and “Mother of Olvera Street” Christine Sterling. China City was mostly burned out, literally and figuratively, by the early 50s.</p>
<p>And of Ms. Toy‘s home, the Ems?</p>
<p>Remember the <a title="KPCA" href="/KelloggPalaceCasaAlta" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Palace/Casa Alta</a> post, which was long on storytelling but short on pretty pictures? I even chided you for looking at a structure that was <i>not</i> our hotel-in-question, by tossing Ã¼ber-comely Bunker Hill lass The Ems smack dab into the mix.<br />
<img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3503/3293618232_7498ba5fd8_o.gif" alt="avertyoureyes" width="456" height="232" /></p>
<p>I even promised I‘d talk about the Ems “next week,” but by <a title="sor" href="/SonsoftheRevolution" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">next week</a> it was President‘s Day, and <i>somebody</i> had to make you mindful of your nation, despite all the patriotic work you were doing watching <a title="gobama" href="http://consumerist.com/5153770/obama-collectors-coins-turn-out-to-be-stickers-stuck-on-regular-coins" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Obama informercials</a>.</p>
<p>Well, now it‘s the week after next, and it‘s time for the Ems, which is replete with pretty pictures but sadly short on storytelling. Here‘s what we know.</p>
<p>Charles Clayton <span class="highlight">Emswiler</span> came to LA in the boom eighties and went into the apartment-house building game. In August of 1905 he pulled permits to build his eponymous Mission-style Ems, designed by none other than Joesph Cather Newsom.  Emswiler died in 1922, age 69, in the apartment house at 321 that bore his name.</p>
<p>It contains 110 rooms, divided into twenty-six apartments according to the 1939 census, sixty-five apartments according to the 1950 Sanborn map.  Here it is before its birth, from the 1896 Sanborn map (321, bottom), and postnatal from the 1906:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3384/3298297798_8d9f28d0ed_o.gif" alt="sanborn1896" width="455" height="309" /></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3297/3297470819_ca1fc8e8ef_o.gif" alt="sanborn06" width="455" height="225" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3083/3285716032_7bba1c3874_o.gif" alt="emsca1906" width="568" height="400" /></p>
<p>Our earliest known shot, above. Pre-1908, because the Kellogg has yet to be built to the north. Notice the three round-arch traceried windows along the street, and the turreted house to the south.</p>
<p>We know that it had a large ballroom, for in 1909 the papers announced that sixty couples participated in the dancing at the inaugural ball honoring President Taft.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3236/3284896999_d78168ba7f_o.gif" alt="ems1910" width="423" height="400" /></p>
<p>The Ems were apartments-of-choice for a collection of colorful characters.</p>
<p><b>1914.</b> “Mohawk Half-Breed” Daniel T. La Rae, alias Daniel T. Ray, was an Ems resident (Emsident?) with Miss Emma Ewalt–they stayed there together, but were (!) unmarried. Daniel spent a lot of time promising to marry Miss Ewalt, even going so far as to travel to Shelby, Ohio, to visit her father. Mostly what Daniel did, though, is borrow money–he needed these sums to purchase marble on bond to build post offices and such. Of course he could be trusted; he <i>was</i> a Federal Officer, after all.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3620/3293617828_ce41427bcc_o.gif" alt="drevil" width="139" height="300" align="left" /><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3228/3292794367_70311fb13d_o.gif" alt="suitor4revenue" width="295" height="300" align="right" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He had shown Emma a badge emblazoned “U. S. Marshal,” but never paid back the money nor made good on his promise of marriage. Of course his badge was a phony as his promises. Turns out his real job was for the Southern Pacific RR, guarding Chinese as they were ferried from San Francisco across the Mexican border line. Chinese actually go home to Mexico. Little known fact.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3306/3292794435_a4db89c461_o.gif" alt="likkerseezed" width="252" height="138" align="right" /><b>1924.</b> Emsians Jack Hart and James Whitmore were no mere bathtub gin fanciers, nor busted-at-the-speak spuds; the Feds seized Hart &amp; Whitmore‘s forty cases of champagne, seventy-five cases of Scotch, and seventy-three cases of gin, crÃ¨me de menthe and grain alcohol down at their warehouse, <a title="1840wetookalittletrip" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=1840+Lebanon+St,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90015&amp;sll=34.034988,-118.270818&amp;sspn=0.000511,0.001727&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=34.036089,-118.270826&amp;spn=0.009122,0.013819&amp;t=h&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1840 Lebanon</a>. The liquor was valued at $40,000. In addition to the liquor, the drys seized a large truck, three touring cars and several rifles.</p>

<p>Above, the Ems in 1912 and a William Reagh image ca. 1960.  Notice the rounded tripartite fenestration, which worked so well with the rest of the faÃ§ade, has been changed to a single remaining arched window, a square window, and a doorway.  This is due to owner William Fisher&#8217;s February 1927 alteration–he hires architect B. N. Rickard, of whom you have never heard, and rightfully so, since this is pretty clunky work, to convert the lobby into two bedrooms and turn the ball room into a new lobby.  (Note too that the neighboring house–built in 1887-88 by Howard W. Mills, of real estate firm Mills, Crawford, Pauly &amp; Clapp–at 327 South Olive has been reduced to a concrete pit, demolished for a parking lot in the summer of 1948. )</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3599/3293618014_50c1a49345_o.gif" alt="jaccuse" width="241" height="191" /><b>1930.</b> An employment agency sent Emsite Erma Gogleu, 16, to <a title="90321" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=903+W+21st+St,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90007&amp;sll=34.034973,-118.278868&amp;sspn=0.001022,0.003455&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=34.035804,-118.279281&amp;spn=0.009122,0.013819&amp;t=h&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">903 West Twenty-First St</a>. to fill a position as a mother‘s helper. As soon as she got the job, she was attacked by mother‘s son James D. Anderson. Erma wasn‘t the first to have met with the fate of an Anderson Employee–one Marguerite Cooper, 23, also testified with Erma in Municipal Court about a similar sitch, and the Judge ordered Anderson held on $10,000 bail.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3568/3293618104_d80f6d693f_o.gif" alt="vroom" width="250" height="104" /><b>1934. </b> Emsman Joe Shaw, 26, was roaring along on his motorcycle on a Friday night down at <a title="bway30" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=S+Broadway+%26+W+30th+St,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90007&amp;sll=34.023089,-118.271749&amp;sspn=0.009123,0.013819&amp;g=broadway+at+30th,+los+angeles,+ca&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=34.023089,-118.271749&amp;spn=0.009123,0.013819&amp;t=h&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">30th and Broadway</a>, when he fatally struck Mrs. Marianna Valenzuela, 58. Hey, I warned you that the Ems lacked gripping and protracted tales. But look at those pretty pictures.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3380/3284898351_261e0b533a_o.gif" alt="ems62" width="492" height="476" /></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3550/3292794609_81e6fbb993_o.gif" alt="exquisitedeadguy" width="179" height="95" align="right" /><b>1942. </b> Every hotel has a suicide. And despite Harold‘s line to his Uncle Victor–“during wartime the national suicide rate goes down”–on Bunker Hill, there‘s still wartime Selbsmord (the <a title="wherewereyouin42" href="/HotelBelmont" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belmont</a> had two in ‘42). It‘s easy to posit that the suicide rate is a constant, and the papers make a point of reporting ”˜em during wartime to detract the populace from all those incoming body bags. If you go for that sort of mass-media-control conspiracy. That notwithstanding, nine months after we got into the war, Joseph Buotha, a 58-year-old former private investigator, ate several bottles of pills in his Ems apartment. He had just written a long telegram to Eleanor Roosevelt, and this note: “Please let me alone. Let fate take its course. Notify John G. Wenk to take care of my belongings. Please don‘t hurt the dog. May God forgive you.”</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3233/3285716376_8b47eab59f_o.gif" alt="emscolorwalkertexasranger" width="490" height="474" /></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3515/3292794639_a79f77e809_o.gif" alt="rupinoida" width="264" height="110" /><b>1949</b>. Joe Rupino, 50, was leaning over the railing on the second story balcony, shaking the dust from a rug, when the railing gave way and he fell fifteen feet to the pavement. Rupino received possible fractures of the right wrist, forearm and shoulder, and a trip to Georgia Street and a transfer to General Hospital.</p>
<p>There‘s that railing! The railing of DEATH!</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3355/3285716656_5ea1e9f56e_o.gif" alt="emsrailing" width="575" height="809" /></p>
<p>Ok, the railing of death. It‘s not much, but it‘s something.</p>
<p>Of course we know how the story ends.  The Ems gets its demo permit pulled in July 1965.  By the summer of &#8217;66 it&#8217;s just a pile where a truck can pull up, while erstwhile neighbor the Casa Alta is undergoing a similar fate:</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/Screen-Shot-2019-12-22-at-2.41.16-PM.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-6952" title="" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/Screen-Shot-2019-12-22-at-2.41.16-PM-1024x812.png" alt="" width="630" height="500" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/Screen-Shot-2019-12-22-at-2.41.16-PM-1024x812.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2009/02/Screen-Shot-2019-12-22-at-2.41.16-PM-300x238.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2009/02/Screen-Shot-2019-12-22-at-2.41.16-PM-768x609.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2009/02/Screen-Shot-2019-12-22-at-2.41.16-PM.png 1719w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>After the last few posts–piles of brick, crenellated castles, Neo-Classical noodling–I am happy to say <i>look at all that stucco</i> (stucco that‘s <u>supposed</u> to be there, not stucco that was thrown over shingle–although to be honest, it wasn‘t thrown over adobe brick, either). The deep arcades, the rounded arches, the low-pitched red tile roofs”¦Mission Revival sure oozes picturesque. Were the square flat roof to call a California antecedent to mind, you might think of the 1894 <a title="burlingametrainstation" href="http://www.pbase.com/jacklouis/image/79762288" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Burlingame train station</a>. <img loading="lazy" title="" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3336/3297357159_ed8695149e_m.jpg" alt="flatroof" width="240" height="149" />The Ems is “twin tower”, Ã¡ la the Santa Barbara Mission, and of course there‘s the contemporary tri-tower version a couple blocks over, the somewhat less Mission and more Moorish <a title="SR" href="/StRegis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">St. Regis.</a></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3533/3285715024_7d7f9463fc_o.gif" alt="ems63" width="506" height="400" /></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3514/3298410086_2e853e475c_o.gif" alt="emsgoing" width="222" height="208" align="left" />The Ems and the Palace, chunks missing from their plaster, give Bunker Hill the appearance of a city pockmarked by battle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it comes to architecture important to this part of the world, it can be argued that Spanish Colonial/Mission Revival is our own honest, expressive flowering, that‘s crowd-pleasing but not childish, sometimes silly but never stupid, hard to notice sometimes and often hard to preserve.</p>
<p>It‘s sad to lose Bunker Hill in general; we&#8217;re sorry to lose the Ems in particular.</p>

Do not confuse this film with <i><a title="NPOD" href="http://www.archive.org/details/Narcotic1967" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Narcotics: Pit of Despair</a></i> (also the Greatest Film Ever Made) or even <a title="narcoticky" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0121587/plotsummary" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>Narcotic</i></a>, which is no slouch either.</p>
<p>Let me say at the outset, unless you are a representative of our law enforcement community, you are not allowed to view this film:</p>

<p>So feel especially naughty in watching it, like sneaking into an R-rated picture when only sixteen. (Believe me, if the Narcotic Educational Foundation of America and their pal Lt. Ray Huber of LA County Sherrif&#8217;s Narcotic Detail were asked if the general public should be allowed to view this in fifty-eight years, they‘d say no. No.)</p>
<p>This picture has everything–prosties, junkies, pushers, neon signs:<img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3376/3242329927_c2bdc35453_o.gif" alt="noblegas" width="525" height="480" /></p>
<p>LA: one big shooting gallery.<br />

<i>He lives from fix to fix and if he is lucky, he dies early, maybe from an overdose, maybe from an infected needle.</i></p>
<p>Shifty characters plan nefarious deeds on Court Street:</p>

<p>Til the coppers roar upon the scene:</p>

<p>The last part of the picture concerns a hype that gets sprung from stir, only to wander the rain-slicked streets of Bunker Hill (and be passed by a Roadmaster fastback):</p>

<p>He passes by the industrial heart of the Hill, <a title="clarkhotelgarage" href="/TruckAmok#comment-62" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fourth and Olive</a> &#8212;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3468/3243160782_301e877a08_o.gif" alt="clarkgarage" width="575" height="323" /></p>
<p>And we turn and look behind him up to Third and Olive. Looming large and tall in the far distance The Palace Hotel, aka the Casa Alta, aka the Kellogg, at 317 S. Olive; below that, just at his shoulder, the <a title="theEms" href="http://www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/collection_database/all/439_architectural_views_for_time_life_project_doomed_walker_evans/objectview_altviewenlarge.aspx?page=51&amp;sort=3&amp;sortdir=asc&amp;keyword=&amp;fp=51&amp;dd1=0&amp;dd2=0&amp;vw=1&amp;collID=0&amp;oID=190037903&amp;vT=1&amp;iID=7&amp;iPage(14)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ems</a>, at <a title="ems2" href="http://jpg3.lapl.org/pics14/00026689.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">337</a>, and to the far left, the Olive Inn at 343.</p>

<p><i>Narcotics have weakened his character. Ninety-nine out of 100 slip back.</i></p>

<p>And don&#8217;t tell Ray Huber what&#8217;s going to <a title="parkercenter" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0zgIzqgxFU&amp;feature=related" target="_blank" rel="noopener">become of society</a>.</p>
