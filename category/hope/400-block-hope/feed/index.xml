The Bunker Hill of Israel Putnam and his bayoneted muzzleloader, not the Bunker Hill of <a href="/SecondBattleofBunkerHill" title="secondbattlebunkerhill" target="_blank">Albert Duarte and his oversized bow</a>.  Perhaps because of the revolutionary association to the Bunker Hill appellation, and because Bunker Hill in the pre-Crash era still held some credibility and panache, it was to where the Sons of the Revolution came to have their library, 437 South Hope Street.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.sr1776.org/SiteResources/Data/Templates/t1.asp?docid=514&amp;DocName=Home" title="GSSR" target="_blank">Sons of the Revolution</a>â€”open to those with a lineal descent from those who fought for the Patriot cause (not as hard to get into as the <a href="http://www.societyofthecincinnati.org/" title="SOC" target="_blank">Society of Cincinnati</a>, but harder to get into than the <a href="http://www.sar.org/" title="SAR" target="_blank">Sons of the American Revolution</a>, which wasnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t founded til thirteen years after the Sons of the Revolution, for reasons I wonâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t get into here)â€”seeks to forever keep alive the first men to fight for our treasured traditions.  And perhaps because YOU had some great great somebody at Cowanâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Ford, they keep a genealogical library so that you may do the necessary research into possible membership.  Today, their 110-year-old collection has 30,000+ volumes kept open to the public, free of charge, in Glendale; but the road there has been bumpy, save for forty years of comparative calm on the Hill.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.srcalifornia.com/nav2.htm" title="SRC" target="_blank">Sons of the Revolution of California</a> was founded in 1893, and by the turn of the century had some 5,000 volumes regarding the Revolution and Colonial America, especially in relation to the West.  Its first establishment was in the offices of the Societyâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s first President, Col. Holdridge Ozro Collins.  <img loading="lazy" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/248/3264127111_83ce1d982f_o.gif" alt="colCollins" height="247" width="222" />Collins was a Los Angeles lawyer (who, besides organizing the California Sons of the Revolution and Society of Colonial Wars, was Mayflower Society, Colonial Governors, Society of the War of 1812, Knights Templar, and Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company of Massachusetts) whose officers were in the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/7294653@N07/2959852285/" title="BrysonBlock" target="_blank">Bryson Block</a>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3363/3264128893_5f5d830166_o.gif" alt="brysonb4" align="left" height="280" width="260" /><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/241/3264129907_516afe1c17_o.gif" alt="brysonafter" align="right" height="280" width="218" /></p>
<p>
Bonebrake-Bryson Block (Joseph Cather Newsom, 1888), NW corner of Second and Spring, shown here before and after its remodel.  It was further remodeled into an open pit, as its corner site is now where the 1948 <a href="http://www.you-are-here.com/los_angeles/mirror.html" title="TM" target="_blank">Times Mirror Building</a> stands.</p>
<p>The Society stayed in the Bryson Block from May of 1893 until June of 1894, when Collins moved his offices, and the library, into the brand-spanking-new Stimson Block (Carroll H. Brown, 1893), NE corner of Spring and Third.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1377/3264452149_c9371b4c94_o.gif" alt="chicagoesque" height="73" width="350" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Stimson Block was the first six-story building in Los Angeles, the first steel frame building in Los Angeles, and the last major example of commercial Richardsonian Romanesque in Los Angeles when it was unceremoniously demolished for a parking lot in July of 1963.  (We do have a good extant Victorian Richardsonian <i>house</i>â€¦and itâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s <a href="http://bigorangelandmarks.blogspot.com/2009/02/no-212-stimson-residence.html" title="stimsonhaus" target="_blank">also Stimsonâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s</a>.)</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3382/3264128241_3dd3b9513c_o.gif" alt="63demo" height="69" width="449" /></p>
<p>In any event, Collins and the library stayed at Stimson Block until it was decided that it was time for Col. Collins to get his room back, and for the library to have a place of its own.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3495/3264953858_6270caabd0_o.gif" alt="hennerendering" align="left" height="314" width="250" />So when the Henne Building, 122 West Third, a five-story French Renaissance office building also designed by Carrol H. Brown opened in the Spring of 1897, the Society took out an office.  The Henne site, west side of Third between Main and Spring, is now buried under the <a href="http://college.usc.edu/geography/la_walking_tour/civic_center/reagan_building.html" title="RRSOB" target="_blank">Ronald Reagan State Building</a> (Welton Becket and Associates, 1990). </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/236/3264127361_0e7bd824a0_o.gif" alt="henneshot" height="272" width="222" /></p>
<p>But the Society kept growing, and a decade laterâ€”January, 1908â€”they were moving boxes into the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/fridayinla/544210848/" title="SFB" target="_blank">San Fernando Building</a> (John F. Blee, 1906), SE corner Fourth and Main.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3522/3264127195_d83fc1629c_o.gif" alt="FernandoPic" height="222" width="222" /></p>
<p>They started knocking out walls on the sixth floor until additional stories were added in 1912 and the Society moved into quarters specifically designed for the library.  By 1914, they outgrew even that and had to take on an additional room.  Making matters worse (good for the library, bad for space concerns) was that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orra_E._Monnette" title="money" target="_blank">Orra Eugene Monette</a>, aka Mr. Bank of America, Society President, (Mayflower, Colonial Wars, Huguenot Society, ad infinitum) gave a large collection to the library.<img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3394/3264127781_bf2051460c_o.gif" alt="OEM" height="221" width="222" /></p>
<p>Again showing their preference for new buildings, the Society turned their eye to the new <a href="http://www.parkinsonarchitecture.com/map/22.html" title="CITBnk" target="_blank">Citizenâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s National Bank Building</a> (Parkinson &amp; Bergstorm, 1914) at the NE corner of Fifth and Spring; the building is still there, but has mysteriously been <a href="http://www.you-are-here.com/downtown/crocker_bank.html" title="strippy" target="_blank">stripped of its architectural embellishments</a>. <img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3297/3264127285_e7b88c6b9d_o.gif" alt="parky" height="304" width="222" /></p>
<p>And there they stayed until Nathan Wilson Stowell donated to the Society a plot of land on Bunker Hill.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/247/3264127543_18641e51f9_o.gif" alt="NWS" align="left" height="300" width="216" /> <img loading="lazy" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/193/3264952280_804938739e_o.gif" alt="stowell" align="right" height="270" width="222" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3494/3264954500_498cbc01d0_o.gif" alt="stowellhotel" align="right" height="313" width="200" />As a master of pipe and irrigation, Stowell became one of the great Southland water gods; in 1889 he built the Stowell Building, AKA the Germain Bldng, at 224 S. Spring (first five-story building in Los Angeles with an electric elevator) and fans of Spring Street surely know the 1913 Stowell Hotel; he built the <a href="http://cinematreasures.org/theater/16/" title="Mayan" target="_blank">Mayan Theater</a>  and financed the <a href="/TheDirtPatchofSecondandHill#comment-38" title="SST" target="_blank">1924 Second Street tunnel</a>.</p>
<p>When Stowell died in 1943, he was the last of the 20 charter members of the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce.  (And although his forebear who came to Massachusettes in 1620 was named Samuel, and the rest of his mishpucha are variously named Abraham, Isaac and Israel, Nathan maintains he is a Protestant.)  Despite his importance to the history of Los Angeles, or perhaps because of it, some cultural terrorist elected not to restore his name to the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?s=int&amp;w=all&amp;q=el+dorado+lofts+downtown&amp;m=text" title="stowellinterior" target="_blank">Stowell</a>, which was renamed the Earle in 1950 after its acquisition by the Milner chain, and redubbed the <a href="http://www.eldoradolofts.com/" title="itscalledthestowelldammit" target="_blank">El Dorado</a> in 1955. </p>
<p>So Stowell donates the land to the Society and made a point of submitting his own plans for the building, to cost $25,000.  In October 1927, they held a ceremonial groundbreaking to turn the first shovelful of earth:</p>

<p>Inside, what more could one ask for?</p>

<p>The secretaire with broken pediment, the Ionic capitals, the Doric pilasters, the plaster medallion, the comforting keystone?  One can gain an almost perfect serenity from gazing into this image (imagining the hypnotic tick-tock of an Elias Ingraham on the mantel&#8230;kept me in ataraxia all these feverish months, allowing me to postpone this post to <a href="http://www.mountvernon.org/support/why_support_mount_vernon/index.cfm/" title="supportMV" target="_blank">Presidentâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Day</a>).</p>
<p>Another corner of quietude and sobriety:</p>

<p>While the library naturally abjured the wild Bunker bacchanal, perhaps we should make mention that it did have some interesting neighbors (okay, so this post doesnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t get away totally scot-free when it comes to tales of queer criminality).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

His dash and vivacity made for a meteoric cafÃ© career, which has come crashing down in Justice Brownâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s court, December 10, 1915.</p>
<p>Mrs. Helen Roberts, Miss Eva Knoll, and Mrs. M. Brader, of the Santa Barbara Apartments, were three of the ladies who fell under his sway.  They probably found him less dashing as they stood in court and identified various articles of jewelry, looted from their rooms in the Santa Barbara, found in de Marquetteâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s possession.</p>
<p>He also made the rounds as none other than <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0187981/" title="crispy" target="_blank">Donald Crisp</a>, and supported himself by writing ficticious checks as the actor/director.  </p>
<p>Turns out that heâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s just Leonell Gianini, a repeated youthful offender whoâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />d been <a href="http://1947project.com/esmeralda" title="senttowhittier" target="_blank">sent to Whittier</a> for burglary.  His folks are ranch owners with a farm out in Ocean Park Heights (renamed Mar Vista in 1924).  Nevertheless, in court, he claimed the jewelry as heirlooms â€œfrom his ancient and honorable familyâ€ in France.  He got five years at Folsom. </p>

Hand over the money or there will be a tragedy.â€</p>
<p>At his trial, Pfeiffer denied contemplating a bank robbery.  â€œI am a somnabulist,â€ he explained.  â€œOn the morning in particular, I walked in my sleep and went over to the table to write this note, which was found by the detectives when they called several hours later.  It was all a dream.  I dreamed that I had held up a bank.â€  Deputy City Prosecutor Ford Q. Jack, reminding the court that in several recent hold-ups the same method had been employed, asked that to curb the dream alibi in prospective bank robbers, Pfeiffer be given the maximum sentence.  Pfeiffer was then sentenced to 180 days in the City Jail to think up new uses for chemistry.</p>

<p>
Of course, deep within the libraryâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s quietude, one couldnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t hear the bulldozers rumbling.  Surely through the 50s they knew which way the wind blew, and it blew some silent but foul CRA halitosis through the cracks in the early 60s.  By 1964 the Society was given notice, and eventually some blood money for the building and expenses incurred for moving and storage.  In November 1968 the Society had moved out the last of their collection; shortly thereafter the bulldozers were deafening.  The latticed windows and oak flooring and everything Independence Hall went crack and crumble.</p>
<p>Today, the <a href="http://forum.skyscraperpage.com/showthread.php?t=154492" title="towerofhope" target="_blank">Citigroup Tower </a>(AC Martin Partners, 1979) sits atop the Hope Street site.  </p>
<p>The library took everything and moved into the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granada_Shoppes_and_Studios" title="granadaSS" target="_blank">Granada Shoppes and Studios</a>, where they remained until 1971.  Unlike anything on Bunker Hill, the Lafayette Park area was left in blithe poverty long enough to allow <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/granadashopperstudiosbuilding/" title="gsandstuds" target="_blank">this building</a> to survive and become an HCM (read about #238 on <a href="http://bigorangelandmarks.blogspot.com/" title="bigorange" target="_blank">BOL</a> in a few weeks) and eventually National Register.</p>

<p>
From there they hunted around and these Colonial folk found another Colonial buildingâ€¦though again, Spanish Colonial.  Built as the Glendale Chamber of Commerce Building in 1929, 600 South Central Avenueâ€”all 4,300 square feet of itâ€”proved the perfect space, especially after the Society filled it with Windsor chairs, gas lamps and (American) Colonial flags.</p>

<img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3017/2567082622_f244256d69.jpg?v=0" alt="The Touraine" vspace="5" width="400" hspace="5" />

<p>In an era of spacious Victorian mansions, one could argue that the Touraine Apartments on Hope Street were 100 or so years ahead of their time. Erected in 1903 and opened in 1904, the units of this neoclassical building were designed to squeeze in a maximum number of tenants at market rates while presenting the illusion of roomy living quarters. At one point, residents were forcibly driven out in favor of higher renters. Before being demolished in the mid 1960s, the Touraine had survived a couple of fires, a colorful cast of characters, an amnesia inducing accident, and at least one suicide.  <br />
<!--break--><br />
<br />
Designed by architect A.L. Haley, who was also responsible for the Higgins Building on Main Street, the Touraine&#8217;s columned facade stood three stories high, while the rear of the structure was eight stories, sloping with the natural terrain of Bunker Hill. Aimed at attracting wealthy renters, the Touraine&#8217;s elegant grand staircase lead up to a large rooftop garden and sun room. Unlike other boarding houses and mansions on the Hill which contained spacious muti-roomed residences, the Touraine&#8217;s apartments claimed to have all the functions of seven rooms squeezed into two, plus a kitchen. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style="text-align: center">
<img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3128/2567082976_d2f2aedc9a.jpg?v=0" width="500" height="196" />
</div>
<p>According to the Los Angeles Examiner, the floor-plan â€œshows a parlor, a living room, a kitchen, a private hall, a private bath and a storage closet. Apparently there are no bedrooms or dining room.â€ The beds actually folded into the wall. One could be disguised as a mantle during the day, the other as a large plate glass mirror.  A writing desk and bookcase were built into a door that concealed a large closet and the dining room table could be folded and hung up. The kitchen contained swinging doors with the stove attached, so that once the cooking was done, the door could be swung out into the living room and the stove used as a heater. </p>
<p>The building, which would have traditionally housed six or seven units contained twenty eight. The inventors of the floor plan were so impressed with their design that they patented the plan, as well as the built-in appliances.   The gimmick of having the comforts of seven rooms in two was successful, and the Touraine Apartments became a fashionable residence for many wealthy patrons. Apparently, they were not wealthy enough.</p>

</div>
<p>The Great Touraine Siege of March 1906 began when hired landlady Estella Palmer collected rent and utility payments from all the tenants and promptly skipped town. Despite having proof of payment, part owner, F.W. Marshall demanded that the residents repay the full amount. Looking to replace the current tenants with higher paying ones, Marshall had no problem turning off the electricity, gas and telephones when the residents refused to double pay. Holding their ground, the tenants lived by candle light and hired lawyers, proclaiming to the Herald newspaper that the landlords â€œare only waiting the chance to cut off our heads.â€ When the water was cut, many residents found they could not tolerate the unsanitary conditions, caved in and moved out. For those who refused to move, Marshall took to breaking into their apartments when they were out and removing all their personal belongings. By the end of the weeklong confrontation, all the residents had been forced out. Apparently, tenants rights had not been established at the turn of the century. A local apartment building sought to capitalize on the stand-off by advertising that residents would not be â€œTourainedâ€ at their establishment. Two months after the incident, the remodeled Touraine re-opened and the owners advertised in the Los Angeles Times for five straight months trying to lure wealthier renters.</p>

<p>
During its six decades the Tournaine suffered two fires. The first in 1905 was caused by what the Times described as an â€œimmense pile of rubbish in the storeroom.â€ The second in 1932 was started when a jilted boyfriend decided to enact revenge on his ex by setting her entire building on fire. Both blazes were minor and resulted in no injuries.</p>

</div>
<p>Like any good Bunker Hill boarding house, the Touraine had its fair share of shady dealings. In 1931, a prospective renter parked his car in front of the building while he ran inside to make lodging arrangements, only to have the auto stolen from under his nose. Dr. John Klutho provided the building with its token suicide by shooting himself in his room in 1934. A few months later, Effie Laurelle Doll sued the owners when a routine fumigation made her violently ill. The judge and jury decided they need to visit the building before making a final decision. By 1956 the Touraine&#8217;s residents were not as elite as they had once been. This was demonstrated when two tenants were arrested for knocking over a local liquor store.</p>
<p>But, of all the goings on at the Touraine, the most bizarre was the case of Miss Ruby Jester.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style="text-align: center">

<p></p>
<p>Ruby Jester was a Southern Bell who in August 1911 announced her engagement to local aviator and academic Sigurd Russell. Shortly after the announcement, Miss Jester, while living at the Touraine, was knocked unconscious after she fainted at the top of the grand staircase and tumbled down it. When she came to, Ruby was struck with amnesia, and claimed to have forgotten all of 1911. She believed that she was still in Atlanta, didn&#8217;t recognize her surroundings or neighbors,  and, even worse,  had no clue who her fiancee was!  Less than a month after getting engaged to Sigurd Russell, she was indeed married&#8230;but not to Russell.  Instead, she wed Jack Tilford, her childhood sweetheart whom she clearly remembered. According to the LA Times, dejected Russell â€œholds no ill will towards his successful rival. He wished them both all happiness.â€</p>
<p>By 1939, the 28 efficient apartments had been divided into 56 units. By 1964 the Touraine was gone.   <br />

<p>From the time Bunker Hill started becoming a fashionable residential neighborhood in the 1880s until it fell out of fashion and started being razed in the 1950s, countless residents filtered in and out of the area. Pioneers like Beaudry and Bradbury are memorialized with their names emblazoned on street signs or buildings. Most have been forgotten. Others, like the Zahn family of Hope Street are a faded memory of the city they helped develop, but whose contributions can linger in the minds of those chasing the ghosts of Los Angeles. </p>
<p><!--break--><br />
Dr. Johann Carl Zahn was born in Austria in 1822 and made his way to Australia when he was in his mid 20s. A deeply religious man, the small fortune he amassed as a successful physician was donated to a mission he helped found. In 1871, Dr. Zahn and his bride, Frances, sailed to San Francisco. The couple originally planned to continue on to Chicago, but the Great Fire killed those plans and they stayed in California where Zahn again built up his bank account as a physician and his wife gave birth to three sons; Oscar, Oswald and Otto.</p>
<div align="center">

</div>
<p>
In 1874, the family moved to Los Angeles, where Dr. Zahn, now going by the name John instead of Johann, began purchasing real estate. By 1878, the family had added two more sons; Lorenzo Paul and Hector. Early on the family resided on Spring Street near a church Zahn had built because, according to the L.A. Times, â€œthe denomination with which he had been accustomed to worship had no church.â€ In 1890 the Zahns decided to relocate to Bunker Hill and had a house built at 427 South Hope Street.</p>
<p>The residence on Hope Street was a large building, yet simple and elegant with far less ornamentation than a lot of the other painted ladies in the neighborhood. Behind the house was a small pasteur where horses were kept and the Zahn boys would sometimes amuse themselves by careening down the grassy hills in the area on homemade sleds. Lorenzo Paul Zahn later became friends with artist Leo Politi and recounted learning to swim at a pond at Second and Beaudry which â€œwas formed by a brook that ran down from Echo Park.â€ Despite the pastoral setting of the family home, Dr. Zahn prophesied to his five sons that one day they would be able to walk from Downtown to Santa Monica on concrete sidewalks.</p>

</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
Dr. J.C. Zahn became a beloved member of the community, treating anyone in need regardless of income or social standing, and contributing to countless charities. He always supported street work in the ever growing city, even if damage was done to his property. Dr. John Carl Zahn passed away after a long illness at the age of 79 in October 1901. In his lengthy obituary, the Times pointed out that â€œhe was never affiliated with secret organizations. His church was his lodge.â€ His family would continue living in the Hope Street residence for another eleven years.

</p>
<p>
While the elder Zahn kept busy with his patients, two of his sons became, of all things, expert homing pigeon trainers. The birds were trained to deliver messages to and from Catalina Island and their pigeon â€œBig Jimâ€ once made the trip from the island in fifty minutes. The Zahns would frequently organize pigeon races from Santa Monica where five of Oswald&#8217;s birds once set a local record by flying in a flock and making the trip in 16 minutes 20 seconds. The brothers also bred and sold homing pigeons until technology made their usefulness obsolete.</p>

</div>
<p>
In 1903, scandal struck the squeaky clean family when Hector Zahn was sued for â€œ$25,000 damage for winning away the wife of Grant Burkert, a drug clerk.â€ Burkert and his wife had been hired by Otto Zahn to work at  Rancho Angelleno near Hemet where Hector frequently resided, training race horses. While Burket was attending to his duties, Hector Zahn kept busy in the house â€œsparkingâ€ Mrs. Burket and would â€œtake her driving with the speedy nags to Hemet and San Jacinto, sometimes returning late at night.â€ Zahn would continually coax the young woman into the barnyard and other cozy places on the ranch and talked her into filing for divorce by lavishing her with â€œjewelry, candy, slippers, toilet articles, perfumes and a racehorse named Bead&#8217;s Orphan.â€ Mr. Burket also claimed that the widow Zahn encouraged the adulterous behavior by suggesting her son and his new squeeze move into the Hope Street house, despite the objections of the rest of the family. Young Hector eventually made an honest woman out of the divorcee by eloping in Arizona.</p>

<i>Mrs. Otto Zahn and the Board of Library Commissioners</i>
</div>
<p></p>
<p>Otto Zahn brought renewed respectability to the family name by marrying Frances Sproston, who had resided in Los Angeles since 1896. Frances Sproston Zahn would serve on the Board of Library Commissioners from 1914 until her death in 1944, and became the first female to be elected President of the Board in 1936.  </p>
<p>Mrs. J.C. Zahn continued overseeing the family real estate holdings after her husband&#8217;s death, and in 1912 had the family home demolished in favor of a three story brick building which was to be called the Zahn Apartments but ended up going by the name Rubaiyat. In 1930, the building was remodeled and renamed the Wickland Apartments and in its last few years was known as the St. Leon until it was demolished around 1963.</p>

By 1937, Dr. Zahn&#8217;s prophecy had come true, and the green pastures of Los Angeles had become a concrete jungle. To celebrate their father and his prediction about sidewalks stretching from Downtown to Santa Monica, the five Zahn brothers got together and walked from the Evening Herald and Express Building to the sea. It probably took them a little bit longer to make the trek than Oswald&#8217;s homing pigeons.</p>
