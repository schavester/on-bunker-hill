										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s not an Edwardian octoplex full of grime and grifters.

<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3462/3351799369_e066ff6523.jpg" alt="archy68" height="387" width="500" /><br />
All and sundry weep for the Richfield.  It”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s not altogether true that everyone turned a blind eye during its ”˜68-9 demo.  Even the Government knew enough to come on out with its Instamatic and take <a href="http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=pphhphoto&amp;action=browse&amp;fileName=ca/ca0200/ca0250/photos/browse.db&amp;recNum=12&amp;itemLink=r?pp/PPALL:@field(NUMBER+@(ca0250))&amp;linkText=-1&amp;title2=Richfield%20Oil%20Building,%20555%20South%20Flower%20Street,%20Los%20Angeles,%20Los%20Angeles%20County,%20CA&amp;displayType=1&amp;maxCols=4" title="clickclick" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lots of snaps</a>. </p>
<p>The November 1968 <i>Times</i> article “Black and Gold Landmark:  End Arrives for LA”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Richfield Building” discusses those architecture students who believed the structure a remarkable example of “Jazz Moderne” worthy of preservation.</p>
<div align="justify">
<i>Wreckers who inspected the building the other day couldn”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t believe the beautiful condition it is in.  Atlantic Richfield officials, who completed the move of their offices to temporary quarters in Union Bank Square over the weekend, have acknowledged its beauty.  The structure is being torn down “with tears in our eyes” they once said.</i>
</div>
<p>And the only mention of the Architects”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Building at 816 West Fifth (which by 1968 had been renamed the Douglas Oil building) and which shared the block with the Richfield was as such:</p>

<p>”¦and that was the end of that.  According to Cleveland Wrecking”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s general manager, the million-dollar site clearance project, of the block bordered by Fifth, Flower, Sixth, and Figueroa, was the largest ever undertaken in the West.</p>
<p>What is this Architects”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Building of which we speak?  Who architected this interbellum edifice?</p>
<p>Downtown is very nearly defined by Parkinson, and you can”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t mention LA without Morgan, Walls &amp; Clements (Stiles sitting in the softest spot of this writer”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s heart), and if I mention Walker and Eisen, you”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />ll say <i>Yaaay!</i> and I”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />ll agree, and we”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />ll high-five, and then get cut off and kicked out of wherever we are.  It sure is swell to take those Conservancy tours and see all these places, but when the Conservancy cats go back to their digs, they return to a Dodd and Richards.</p>
<p>And you say, who?</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_J._Dodd" title="WJD" target="_blank" rel="noopener">William J. Dodd</a>, student of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Le_Baron_Jenney" title="8675309" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jenney</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solon_Spencer_Beman" title="theBman" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beman </a>  is one of the great Midwestern architects.  He came to California and is credited–though scholars still dispute to what extent–with a portion of Julia Morgan”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s 1914-15 <a href="http://www.bluffton.edu/~sullivanm/jmexaminer/jmexaminer.html" title="examroom" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Examiner Building</a>. This he did with his partner at the time J. Martyn Haenke.  In 1916 he partners with engineer William Richards.  They produced so many an important Los Angeles structure that I will at some point in the near future add their full history as a comment appendage to this text, to keep from having too many appetizers before our twelve-story entrÃ©e. </p>
<p>We&#8217;re talking about the southeast corner of Fifth and Figueroa, not to be confused with our friend on the kitty-corner to the northwest, the <a href="/TheMonarch" title="theMoanarch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monarch Hotel</a>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3547/3352626380_1d8efb09b5_o.gif" alt="ArkyContract" align="right" height="297" width="259" /><br />
The first rumblings about the southeast corner of Fifth and Figueroa come in February 1926, when mention is made of preliminary plans and lease negotionations for a million-dollar skyscraper to house LA”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s building trade.  Sponsoring the project are Morgan, Walls and Clements, Dodd and Richards, Reginald D. Johnson, Webber, Staunton and Spaulgin, Carlton Monroe Winslow, Elmer Gray and McNeal Swasey.</p>
<p>The big announcement is made in February 1927 about the $650,000 height-limit to be built on the southeast corner of the Fifth and Figueroa.  To be known as the Architect”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Building, after New York and Chicago, it would be the third of its nature in America:  a whole structure exclusively devoted to the various branches of the construction industries.  It is to be of a “modified Italian” architectural treatment according to the associated architects drawing up the specifications:  Roland E. Coate, Dodd and Richards, Reginald D. Johnson, McNeal Swasey, Carleton Monroe Winslow, and Witmer and Watson.</p>

Twelve stories high, with a site of 60 by 156 feet, it is to be of steel reinforced concrete, 143 offices, its exterior finished in plaster with cast-stone trimmings.  Its seven upper floors of the building are to be leased to prominent architects, its first floor and mezzanine to be occupied by the Metropolitan Exhibit of Building Materials–a massive exhibit of every branch of the building industry, renamed the Architects”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Building Materials Exhibit.</p>
<p>By November of 1927, the building was nearing completion.  Preston S. Wright, president of Wright-Aiken, owners of the AB, ran down some of the tenants:  Rapid Blueprint Company;  D. C. Writhg, insurance; E. E. Holmes, insurance; William Simpson Construction Company, builders; Brian D. Seaver, attorney; and architects D &amp; R, Coate, Johnson, Winslow, and William Lee Wollett.</p>

<p>The depression would not be good to the Architects”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />.  It was foreclosed on its $360,000 outstanding bonds in February 1933.  It was put under federal receivership and forced into a court-ordered sale, which didn”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t occur until May of 1938, when an F. V. Fallgren and associate could pony up the 300k to a trustee representing the bondholder”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s committee.</p>

One bit of drama:  Evans Erskine, 34, a jobless Air Corps vet, figured that 1955 would be Year Last.  He climbed to the ninth-floor fire escape of the Architects”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Building and hoisted himself over the railing.  Richard McGowan, a controller for Dames &amp; Moore Civil Engineers, ran down the hall and and grabbed the hands of the nattily dressed, ledge-teetering Erskine poised 100 feet above Fifth Street.  Here, McGowan reenacts his daring hand-grabbing:</p>

<p>In 1959 it is purchased by Douglas Oil, a southern California independent who run three refineries and 300-some gas stations in the Southland.

Listen, it”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s coming from over by the Richfield building.  </p>
<p>Richfield, another oil company, who owned that big ol”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> black and gold tower to the south, had merged with east coasters Atlantic Refining in 1966.  Richfield had already begun buying up the block for piecemeal parking, and as Atlantic-Richfield Co. they purchased the whole kit.  And kaboodle.  That called for the end of the Architects”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />, as ARCO intended to build not one but two Miesian towers (though their New York twin-tower counterparts broke ground four years earlier, there appears to be an aesthetic epoch between AC Martin&#8217;s work and Yamasaki&#8217;s tube-frame twins of lower Manhattan, whose postmodern sensibility stems from a neo-Gothic use of aluminum).</p>

<p>Just to clear up one bit of confusion.  Despite early mention that this building was to be of the combined effort of Roland E. Coate, Dodd and Richards, Reginald D.

It was that hitherto unsung monument of Los Angeles deco:  the Monarch Hotel.<img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3080/2854380661_5b4d880015_o.gif" alt="monarkedelic" height="518" width="400" /></p>
<p>
The Monarch opened in mid-October, 1929.  It contained sixty-six hotel rooms, fourteen single apartments, twelve double apartments, a five-room bungalow on the roof, three private roof decks planted rich with shrubbery, and a lobby embellished with hand-decorated ceilings.  It was entirely furnished by Barker Brothers with furniture of “modern type and design.”</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3256/2854930762_6002240a16_o.gif" alt="modernistic" height="512" width="354" /></p>
<p>From the outset, crime dogged the Monarch.  Sort of.  The first occupants of the bridal suite, in November 1929, were Motorcycle Officer Bricker of Georgia-Street Traffic Investigation and former Miss Losa Pope (the now newly-minted Mrs. Bricker, a purchasing agent at Forest Lawn).  <br />
<img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3204/2854943210_fc884285d1_o.gif" alt="loveatfirsthandcuff" height="130" width="486" /><br />
They met when he had arrested her for speeding.  On their first morning together as Man and Wife, breakfasting on the roof garden outside their bridal suite, they were mobbed by twenty some-odd members of the Force who decided to burst in and make merry with fellow officer and his tamed scofflaw.</p>
<p>Real crime did, in fact, visit upon the Monarch.  (This may have had something to do with opening two weeks before the Crash.)  For example:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3166/2854943232_c5f52daa7f_o.gif" alt="betrayal" align="right" height="97" width="200" />Night clerk H. N. Willey was behind the desk at the Monarch when, just after midnight on June 16, 1930, a bandit robbed him of $26. Willey phoned Central Station.  Meanwhile, officers Doyle and Williams, on patrol, observed a man hightailing it through an auto park near the hotel.  Deciding that he wasn”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t running for his health (this being some years before the jogging craze), they gave chase and caught him in an alley.  They next observed a patrol car flying to the Monarch.  Putting two and two together, they took their prisoner to the hotel, where he was id”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />d by Willey.  Turns out he was George H. Hall, 24, a recent arrival in Los Angeles.  </p>
<p>H. N. Willey continued to ply the night clerk trade, and was doing so when two men entered on the early morning of August 31, 1931.  When Willey showed them to their room, they pulled out a gun and tried to lock him in the closet.  The attempt failed because the door had no outside lock, so the hapless crooks ran downstairs, recovered the $2 they had paid for the room and fled.</p>
<p>H. N. makes the papers again in November of 1931, when on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving Los Angeles is hit by a massive crime wave, in which over a dozen brazen robberies of hotels, groceries, theaters, pedestrians, folks in autos, etc. are shot at and robbed; Willey looks down the barrel of a large-bore automatic and forks over $25.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3195/2854995180_a1ef156c22_o.gif" alt="drinkup" height="679" width="505" /><br />
One thing that”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s nice about the Monarch?  It”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s nice to have a bar downstairs.  Edgar Lee Smith lived, and drank, at the Monarch.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3099/2854108157_ef5e354468_o.gif" alt="deltadawn" align="right" height="139" width="231" /><br />
August 23, 1946.  Smith, 51, had been drinking in the Monarch bar but neglected to keep to the cardinal rule of always keeping on the good side of one”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s bartender.  This resulted in an after-hours duel that left his bartender, James Donald Chaffee, 28, stabbed to death.  When the Radio Officers Hill and Finn found Chaffee”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s body on sidewalk, they went to Smith”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s room, where they found him changing his clothes, and seized a penknife with a one-inch blade.</p>
<p>The fight began when, according to Smith, “Jimmy got sore because I stole his girl.”  Smith added that barkeep Chaffee, in retaliation, cut Smith off.  Smith, in counter-retaliation, cut Chaffee.  <br />

Smith plead guilty to manslaughter and was sentenced to one to ten in San Quentin.</p>

Gilbert Carvajal was a 17 year-old Marine stationed at Del Mar, part of Pendleton.  He was at the Monarch on May 9, 1957, with his 45 year-old lady-friend Frances Nishperly when it all began.  It was 1:15am and he decided it wise to hold up night clerk Frost E. Stacklager (H. N. Willey having retired, apparently) and make off with $22 and jewelry.  A few minutes later the two robbed the <a href="http://www.apartmentratings.com/rate/CA-Los-Angeles-Bixel-House-775810.html" title="625sBix" target="_blank">Trent Hotel</a> of $57.50; despite holding the clerk at knifepoint, the two next fled the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=549+Wall+St,+90013&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=66.281516,113.203125&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=34.045583,-118.246472&amp;spn=0.008659,0.013819&amp;t=h&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr" title="wallst" target="_blank">Floyd Hotel</a> empty-handed, but snagged $45 from the till at the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=605+w+27th+los+angeles+ca&amp;sll=34.057459,-118.261986&amp;sspn=0.008657,0.013819&amp;layer=c&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=34.028762,-118.276169&amp;spn=0.00433,0.006909&amp;t=h&amp;z=17&amp;iwloc=addr&amp;cbll=34.027158,-118.276828&amp;panoid=V_0H_NAwSYsEgKF1V6Xhaw" title="autoclub" target="_blank">Auto Club Hotel</a> minutes later.

Ms. Nishperly insisted Carvajal had kidnapped her from the corner of <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=W+Pico+Blvd+%26+S+Hope+St,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90015&amp;sll=34.040587,-118.265719&amp;sspn=0.008659,0.013819&amp;layer=c&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=34.040587,-118.265719&amp;spn=0.008659,0.013819&amp;t=h&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr&amp;cbll=34.03952,-118.26571&amp;panoid=V_0H_NAwSYsEgKF1V6Xhaw" title="abducted" target="_blank">Pico Blvd. and Hope St</a>., but police elected to discount this story.</p>

Now, people are forever plunging off the precipices afforded by tall structures (a quick peruse of On Bunker Hill proves that) and that”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s a person”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s right and due.

<p>Buddy was one such excitable pooch, who went nuts and ran right off the top of the Monarch Hotel!  Of course the Hand of God intervened, and Buddy–a 2 year-old fox terrier&#8211;fell one hundred feet, landing atop an auto roof, but emerged without a scratch, May 1, 1931.  (Apparently Buddy had landed on one of the small unbraced portions of the auto top; parking station attendants ran out when they heard a windshield smash and found a confused dog standing on top the machine, looking for a place to descend.)</p>
<p>Buddy”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s daddy, Jimmy Van Scoyoe, was looking frantically for his pooch and had no idea of his aerial adventure when he peered off the roof and saw his Buddy surrounded by a puzzled crowd.  Jimmy is reported to have tightly clasped Buddy in his arms and vowed to never let him out of his sight again “even if I have to keep him in bed with me when I go to sleep.”  Damn straight!</p>

<p>Who loves the lost Monarch?  People are quick to fetishize the felled Richfield Tower, and with good reason (I, too, am an ardent obsessive–even owning parts of it); but isn”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t it a bit”¦New York?  Doesn”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t it owe a major debt to <a href="http://www.aviewoncities.com/nyc/americanradiatorbuilding.htm" title="TheARB" target="_blank">Hood”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s American Radiator</a> Building?  Sure, some might argue that the Streamline Moderne is more natively Angeleno, but not only was that industrial-inspired application an Internationalist movement, but one also feels in its nautical element a particular evocation of our neighbor to the north, San Francisco.</p>
<p>What is elementally endemic to the land, <i>here</i>, is the Ziggurat Moderne of the Monarch Hotel–that there is something in the setback style that elicits a feeling for the indigenous, the “really” American, in that the mock-Mayan comes closest to the true architecture of this part of the world.  The core of this argument comes, of course, from <a href="http://davidszondy.com/future/city/mujica.htm" title="mujica" target="_blank">Francisco Mujica</a>”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s   1929 <i>History of the Skyscraper</i>, where he hints at just that–that pre-Columbian pyramids are the correct expression of modernity, and vice versa (hence the natural evolution of the 1916 New York setback laws”¦glorious mother of what Koolhaas termed the <a href="http://thenonist.com/index.php/thenonist/permalink/hugh_ferriss_delineator_of_gotham/" title="avoidthenoid" target="_blank">Ferrissian Void</a>).   </p>
<p>Thus–where one might see the Monarch as somewhat <i>squat</i>:<br />

&#8230;we should take that as <i>monumentality</i> in its most impressive (if not oppressive, if that”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s what reverberates in your Incan blood) form.</p>

<p>1950, twenty years after the installation of the Monarch:</p>

<p>1953, with the addition of the Harbor Freeway:</p>

<p>After fifteen years of <i>Sturm n Drang</i>, on February 3, 1964, the $350 million Bunker Hill Urban Renewal Project got its first bite–Connecticut General Life offered $3.3 million for the block-square site that housed the Monarch Hotel.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3076/2854943558_932ecc371a_o.gif" alt="sold" height="146" width="575" /></p>
<p>CRA Chairman William T. Sesnon Jr., expressed his elation:  “The sale is virtually completed.  We are overjoyed by this development.  It”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s our hope it will serve as the real kickoff for the entire Bunker Hill project.”</p>
<p>Thirty days later–March 4, 1964:<br />
<img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3101/2854095639_f2bd92c544_o.gif" alt="downitgoes" height="661" width="400" /></p>
<p>On March 30, 1965, red-jacketed attendants ushered dignitaries under a white-fringed canopy, where they watched a bulldozer tear up some concrete.  “Welcome to Bunker Hill–at last,” proclaimed Sesnon.  “This is the start of something dramatic.”<br />

Some of the luster of Sesnon”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s kickoff was dulled when in 1966–with the Union Bank half built–City Administrative Officer C. Erwin Piper and his staff issued a scathing report on the CRA.  It sited faulty operational control, an absence of clear-cut policies and poor internal coordination, at terrific taxpayer expense.  By the end of 1967 no more land had been disposed of, the CRA had lost half its department heads, had no executive director, and Sesnon had been replaced by Z. Wayne Griffin.</p>

The Battle of Bunker Hill would continue to be waged–that long, slow, protracted engagement, which like its previous fifteen years, would need another fifteen years before things shifted into high gear again.</p>
