He&#8217;d spent the evening ofÂ February 25, 1928, drinking &#8212; most likely in one of the dozens of blind pigs operating in the city during that time.

When his 30 year old son, Joseph Jr. came out to see what had caused the racked and saw his inebriated father lurch out of the automobile, he reamed the old man a new one. Once the shouting had died down Joseph Sr. burst into tears, declaring that he no longer wished to live.</span>

<p>October 26, 1921</p>
<p>A wrestling match between two men, one of whom claimed to be the champion of the world, would cost George Katis of 100 South Olive Street his pride and $2,250 ($26,701.42 in current dollars), when the match turned out to be a fake.</p>
<p>George had been out for a stroll in a local park when he bumped into a pair of wrestlers. The men said that they had a way for George to make a bundle; all he had to do was to put up $1000 as a forfeit, make a side bet of $1250 on a match between them, and back up the truck to cart off his winnings. This sounded like a sure thing to George who promptly ponied up the cash, and agreed to meet the wrestlers at their hotel on Hill Street the next day for the bout.</p>
<p>The following day George arrived at the designated meeting place as promised, but neither the wrestlers nor his money turned up. The hotel desk clerk informed the poor sucker that the men he&#8217;d described were not even registered there.</p>
<p>George may be forgiven for taking a tumble onÂ the fake match, because during the 1920s wrestling was extremely popular and there were many wrestlers and promoters touring the country. Unfortunately not all of them were on the up and up, as George had discovered.<img loading="lazy" border="0" align="right" width="202" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3243/3116329545_9c1400f4d7_m.jpg" alt="strangler lewis" height="240" /></p>
<p>There were crooks and con artists in wrestling, but there were some honest Joes too. Some of the straight shooters were showmen, and would become legends. Wrestling as entertainment originated with the &quot;Gold Dust Trio&quot;. The trio included wrestler (and REAL World Champ) Ed &quot;Strangler&quot; Lewis (see photo), promoter Toots Mondt, and Lewis&#8217; manager Billy Sandow. Modern wrestling owes a huge debt to the Gold Dust Trio, and especially to Toots, who convinced Lewis and Sandow to implement a new form of wrestling which combined features of boxing, freestyle, and most importantly, theater. Dubbed &quot;Slam Bang Western-Style Wrestling&quot;, it was a huge hit with fans.</p>
<p>So, the next time that you&#8217;re parked on your sofa in front of your big screen TV enjoying a WWF Friday night Smackdown, send up a silent thank you to Strangler, Toots, and Billy.</p>

He picked fruit alongside the family for several days, eventually convincing the couple to turn the girl over to him. Mr. Lindsay said that he knew a woman with money who could provide Beatrice with everything that she lacked as the child of itinerate laborers. In truth, he kidnapped the girl and took her with him to <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Los Angeles</st1:place></st1:city>, where he checked in at the Hotel Cecil for a few nights.<img loading="lazy" border="0" align="right" width="301" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3188/3097910041_65eed3573d_o.jpg" alt="hotel cecil" height="400" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'"></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Then Frank did what so many other fugitives had done before him â€“ he sought refuge in a Bunker Hill rooming house.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'"></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Representing himself as Mr. R.F.

Upon her return home, Beatrice was able to provide information about Frank, but the elusive spouse slaughterer continued to evade capture.</span></span></p>

William continued to devour his favorite true detective magazines, and in one of them he read a lurid tale about the grisly murder of a <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Seattle</st1:place></st1:city> housewife. In the same magazine he found a description of the missing husband who was being sought for the killing â€“ and William strongly suspected that the wanted man was none other than his former cook!Â <o:p></o:p></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><span>Â </span></span></span></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><span></span> </span></span></span></span></p>

Not only was he a cook, he was also an accomplished plumber. Sanborn told Lindsay that he needed some work done at his home and, sweetening the pot with the offer of some under-the-table cash, Sanborn was able to get his plumbing repairs completed before he dropped the dime on the wife killer.<o:p></o:p></span> </span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'">As an upstanding citizen and detective wannabe, Sanborn needed to be absolutely sure that he was pursuing the right man. He contacted the homicide squad and was handed a photo of Lindsay, which he immediately identified as an image of his former employee.<span>Â  </span>In a move that was dangerous at best and completely insane at the worst, Sanborn then confronted Frank with the photo at the restaurant where he was working. Frank took the picture and held it in his fingers, thereby conveniently fingerprinting himself. When cops ran the prints, they matched those of the runaway murderer.<span>Â  </span>Detectives turned up at the Stanley Apartments at 210 South Flower later that evening, and took Lindsay into custody without incident.<o:p></o:p></span> </span></span></p>

The surprise was that he was galvanized into action.
</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
Pompey and his mistress, Mrs. Mitalzo, were out for a stroll on <st1:street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">South Bunker Hill Avenue</st1:address></st1:street>. The dog became increasingly agitated as they drew nearer to a rooming house just up the block. A few doors away from the building, Pompey began to growl. When his hair stood up on end,Â Mrs. MitalzoÂ bent over to try to soothe him. She had relaxed her grip on Pompeyâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s leash for only a moment, and it was then that Pompey broke free. He ran up the steps of the building, and into the apartment of Mr. William A. Stark.
</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
The 24 year old Stark had just been discharged from his job as an elevator operator at a downtown hotel. Management had told him that he was through because he didnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t close the elevator doors properly. The despondent man had taken several newspapers and fashioned them into a long cone. He placed the small end of the improvised suicide device over a gas jet in his room, and he placed the large end over his face. Stark then turned on the gas and lay down to die.
</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
When Pompey entered the room, Stark was unconscious and near death. The valiant dog dragged the motionless Stark into the safety of the hallway. Mrs. Mitalzo ran into the rooming house to search for Pompey and discovered him watching over the dying man.
</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
Police were summoned and Stark was taken to the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:placename w:st="on">Receiving</st1:placename> <st1:placetype w:st="on">Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>, where he was revived. Pompey stayed around long enough to see the ambulance pull away. Apparently satisfied with the outcome, the dog rejoined his mistress and the two continued their stroll.
</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
Pompey vanished from the pages of the Los Angeles Times after his brief moment in the limelight, but his famed counterpart, Rin-Tin-Tin, was just beginning his film career in 1923.<img loading="lazy" border="0" align="right" width="330" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3069/2924364067_e0750ee01b_o.jpg" alt="rintyradio" height="269" />
</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
Rin-Tin-Tin was only five days old when he was rescued from a bombed out kennel in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">France</st1:place></st1:country-region>. WWI was drawing to a close when a <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region> solider, Lee Duncan, spotted the kennel and decided to investigate. He saved two of the puppies and brought them home with him to <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Los Angeles</st1:place></st1:city>.Â 
</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
Rin-Tin-Tin (aka Rinty) was seen performing in a local dog show by movie producer Charles Jones â€“ and a star was born. Rinty worked hard and would often relax by listening to the radio.
</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
His career lasted for over a decade and eventually earned him a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Rinty passed away quietly in his sleep at the ripe old age of 14.

The force of the explosion hurled him back against some pipes. The injured man was snapped back to his senses when a second blast thrust him out of the manhole and into the street. He was so violently tossed around that he rolled for a few feet, and then fell backwards through the manhole. Unbelievably, although badly burned, Harry survived.

<p style="margin: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
Several bystanders were hurt, including a small boy named Albert Adams who had been attracted to the site moments before the blast.

Albert was curious and had poked his head into the hole to see what was going on when the first detonation occurred. The lucky young man escaped with nothing more serious than singed eyebrows.
</p>
<p>The eruption was so powerful that a heavy iron manhole cover at Fourth and Hill Streets flew up into the air and flipped over several times before returning to Earth.

In the early 1900s the standard for female beauty was set by the fictional â€œGibson Girlâ€. Created and popularized by the illustrator <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Dana_Gibson" title="Charles Dana Gibson">Charles Dana Gibson</a>, the Gibson Girl was depicted as a subtle teaser of men. <span>Â </span>She was statuesque and graceful with an impossibly tiny waist. Her long hair was styled in a sophisticated cascade of curls piled high upon her head.<span>Â  </span>It was a challenge to wear a hat on such big hair, so the clever Gibson Girls used hatpins which were more than a foot long.

<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black; font-family: Arial"></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black; font-family: Arial">K.W. Cross (19), C.J. Terry (20), and R.P.

In fact, each of the swabbies was positively desperate to get out of uniform and back into civilian life, so they hatched a plan to get themselves discharged from the service.</span></p>
<p><!--break--><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black; font-family: Arial"></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black; font-family: Arial">The young men had heard that if they were arrested for a crime, their naval careers would come to a screeching halt â€“ so they burglarized a small tobacco store at Fourth and Hill Streets. They made no attempt to flee following the crime, and were busted at the scene by Police Detectives Simpson and Jarves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black; font-family: Arial"></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black; font-family: Arial">Itâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s possible that Cross, Terry, and Cullison were naive enough to believe that once theyâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />d committed a crime, theyâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />d simply be cut loose from the Navy and put back on the streets to pursue merrier lives. If so, they must have been very disappointed. Although they were immediately discharged at San Pedro as expected, all three youths were then taken into custody, and confined in the City Jail for six months each on the burglary rap.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black; font-family: Arial"></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black; font-family: Arial">We hope that the former mariners embraced Samuel Johnsonâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s philosophy, and enjoyed their stints in the city slammer&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black; font-family: Arial"></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">â€œNo man will be a sailor who has contrivance enough to get himself into a jail; for being in a ship is being in a jail, with the chance of being drowned&#8230; a man in a jail has more room, better food, and commonly better company.â€ <br />

In fact, theyâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />d already survived a shoot out with one posse, and it would take at least one more to bring them to justice. Due mainly to the support of people in the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:placename w:st="on">San Joaquin</st1:placename> <st1:placetype w:st="on">Valley</st1:placetype></st1:place>, both robbers had managed to evade the law. Southern Pacific Railroad had cut a ruthless swath through <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:state w:st="on">California</st1:state></st1:place>, displacing people and gobbling up their land, so when Evans and Sontag struck out at the much despised company, people cheered.Â <br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><em><img loading="lazy" border="0" width="240" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3106/2759730283_9c45c04341_m.jpg" alt="sontag death" height="153" /></em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><em>John Sontag near death as posse looks on.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">Neither children nor Pinkerton Detectives ended up capturing Evans and Sontag. On May 28, 1893, the bandits were surrounded by a posse of local lawmen, and a furious gun battle ensued. Both men were wounded. Sontag died of his injuries, but Evans managed to escape. He came upon the home of Mrs. Parsons, who invited him in, and then dressed his wounds and put him to bed. Evans knew that his career as a train robber had ended, and he agreed to let Mrs. Parsons turn him in to the law if she would agree to split the reward she received with his wife â€“ which she promptly did.Â <br />
</span><span style="font-size: 11pt"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"></span><span style="font-size: 11pt">While Evans was awaiting trial, his wife and daughter were contacted by a <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on">San Francisco</st1:city></st1:place> theater company. The girls were offered money to appear as themselves in a production about one of the train robberies. Both mother and daughter agreed, putting the money theyâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />d earned in a defense fund for Chris.<span>Â  </span>It was to no avail however, and Evans was sentenced to prison for life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"></span><span style="font-size: 11pt"><img loading="lazy" border="0" width="345" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3091/2759730263_79dcd6c15c.jpg" alt="evans playbill" height="500" /></span></p>

Evans managed to escape from jail before he could be transported to Folsom Prison. <span>Â </span>After a brief taste of freedom, he was recaptured. Evans served his time and was released in 1911. He died in a state hospital a few weeks later.</span></p>
