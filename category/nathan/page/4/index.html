<p>Folk will on occasion ask me what, if anything, is left of Bunker Hill.  Glad you asked, I”&#x2122;ll reply, answer being, nothing really, but I am awfully fond of this particular <i>dirt contour</i>.  If they don”&#x2122;t politely turn away, I”&#x2122;ll commence upon a detailed discourse on said excrement-laden dirt contour in question, and then they”&#x2122;ll politely turn away.  </p>
<p>Strange as it sounds, I love this dirt.  I have since I was one day idling in my auto adjacent this, the northwest corner of <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=163+S+Hill+St,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90012&amp;sll=34.061761,-118.246064&amp;sspn=0.008248,0.017381&amp;layer=c&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=34.057335,-118.246086&amp;spn=0.008249,0.017381&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr&amp;cbll=34.062117,-118.245666&amp;panoid=k8H0gkm54sNy42YNk_9ZiQ" title="2ndHill" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Second and Hill</a>, when I saw this form and it recalled an image lodged in some dim grotto of my brain:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3188/2748162947_2f4d435d4b_o.gif" alt="TheOdalisque" height="306" width="575"><br>
And I thought, I know that form.  That contour.  Like a beautiful woman in repose. Debased somehow, but still noble.  Ingres”&#x2122; Odalisque has become Manet”&#x2122;s Olympia.  </p>
<p>So here I am in pith helmet and plus-fours, poking around the strangely stained abandoned sweatpants and taking in the stench of urine steaming away on a hot summer”&#x2122;s day.  My own Persepolis, only with more recent death and egesta.  A remaining honest remnant of Bunker Hill, carved in dirt.  There”&#x2122;s an old Yiddish proverb–Gold”&#x2122;s father is dirt, yet it regards itself as noble.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3217/2750287727_340af323c5_o.gif" alt="SculptedbytheMaster" height="431" width="575"></p>
<p>Let”&#x2122;s take a detailed look at the block our patch of dirt calls home.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2078/2748920876_c55dee3c13_o.gif" alt="2ndHill1888" height="398" width="575"></p>
<p>In 1888, on the 30-40&#8242; bluff overlooking Hill  there&#8217;s a large house, center, and another (with a “old shanty”&#157;, it is noted) at the corner of Second and Hill.  The round structure above the house on the right reads “arbor lattice.”&#157;  Note the porches on the <a href="/node/174" title="Argyle88" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Argyle</a>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3044/2748921226_6a72e8540d_o.gif" alt="2ndHill1894" height="391" width="575"><br>
1894, and 133 Hill has built terraced steps up to its manse.  Our house in the corner has sadly lost its shanty.  Notice the addition of the Primrose hotel at 421/419 West 2nd.  At the bottom it reads “Vertical bank 30”&#x2122; high.”&#157;  The house near 1st has been razed but 109 Hill has been added.  104 Olive has shown up, top right.  And yes, that says “Lawn Tennis Courts.”&#157;  </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3009/2748920938_b3282498dc_o.gif" alt="2ndHill1906" height="405" width="575"><br>
It”&#x2122;s 1906, and much has changed:  our little friend in the corner has disappeared.  In its place, just to the north, two lodging houses at 411 and 409.  To the west, Hotel Locke.  (Hotel Locke shows up in the <i>Times</i> in 1897 and disappears in 1912.)  Olive Court has wrapped around and filled in, and the tennis lawn has given way to our old friend the <a href="/TheMooreCliff" title="MCMooreCliff" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moore Cliff</a>.  The former single family dwelling at 109 has been enlarged to become the El Moro Hotel.  Note the Hotel Cecil in the upper right.  Hill now has a 15”&#x2122; retaining wall; the houses average 30”&#x2122; above grade.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2178/2748086463_89f873a00a_o.gif" alt="2ndHill1953" height="429" width="575"><br>
But now it”&#x2122;s 1950 and the drastic has occured.  Where once Second Street was sixty feet across, it is now 100, due to the construction of the Second Street tunnel, which opened in July of 1924.  (As Mary mentioned in her post, the Argyle lost its porches.)  Also lost were the two structures below the Primrose at 411 and 409, not to mention the Hotel Locke.  These were even gone before the great excavation.  The Hotel Cecil has, as you might imagine, been renamed, so as not to be confused with the <a href="http://www.you-are-here.com/downtown/hotel_cecil.html%201924" title="ShouldhavenameditBenny" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hotel Cecil</a>.  We even have a little gas station.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, ca. 1952:  the Moore Cliff front and center, the bipartite El Moro, and the Hotel Gladden up the block in the corner.  And there”&#x2122;s the Texaco station that popped up.  (Faithful Bunker Hillers will recognize the looming backside of the Melrose Annex and the Dome up top.)</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3256/2748370835_81dda78163_o.gif" alt="MC52" height="351" width="575"> </p>
<p>But back to the “great excavation.”&#157;  Remember, once Hill had, well, a great hill looming o”&#x2122;er.  It was true here, at our corner in question:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3081/2748086099_5e90dd32db_o.gif" alt="2ndHIll1932" height="316" width="575"></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2078/2748920808_31f90220af_o.gif" alt="2ndHilltoday" height="316" width="575"> </p>
<p>What happened to the giant pile of dirt (upon which 411 and 409, and the Hotel Locke once<br>
sat) as seen in the 1932 photograph? </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3270/2748997486_fbf001bd54_o.gif" alt="excavation" height="111" width="516"></p>
<p>As can be barely viewed just below the Moore Cliff in the ”&#x2122;32 shot, a lot fronting Hill has already been excavated for auto parking, and in May of 1935 the two adjacent lots at the corner were leveled by Los Angeles Rock and Gravel, removing 40,000 cubic yards of earth adjoining the tunnel ramp, measuring some 45hx82wx157d&#8217;. One lot owner, C. J. Heyler, rented the space to P. F. Drino for automobile parking; Heyler stated that construction on the lot was planned. That, of course, never happened. </p>
<p>This, then, is how we ended up with Hill carvings that have remained unchanged for seventy-three years.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3217/2750287727_340af323c5_o.gif" alt="2ndHill" height="431" width="575"> </p>
<p>And still fulfilling the same purpose.<img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3110/2748154243_c473fa11af_o.gif" alt="looknorth2H" height="547" width="575"></p>
<p>Looking southeast at our dirt, 1967, before her Hill Steet side had her top shaved off:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2315/2748339801_0082586a01_o.gif" alt="atthedirt67" height="313" width="529"> </p>

<p>A quick word about the Second Street tunnel–with the millions the CRA is again pouring into Bunker Hill, do you think we could throw a few bucks toward a new railing?  To refashion the original concrete couldn”&#x2122;t run that much, and if not an aesthetic improvement, would be arguably safer than chain link.  Right? </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your attention to this matter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In any event, such is the tale of some simple dirt on a single block.  Tune in next week for tales of terror as they relate to this part of the world.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3009/2751541264_595bd3d28a_o.gif" alt="dirtfromheaven" height="416" width="575"></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3018/2793152783_d9c276e302_o.gif" alt="patchfromzep" height="400" width="505"><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3063/2748989296_c64952c887_o.gif" alt="archaeologizing" height="431" width="575"></p>
<p>And now, you can launch into your own spiel about the dirt contours of Hill Street.  I suggest a visit and have a whiff for yourself of what once was Bunker Hill.  Serves to add that dose of realism guaranteeing the polite turning-away of cocktail party folk.</p>

Accursed rings!  Hammer-mad Japanese!  Arms-manufacturing Baronesses!  Welcome to Zelda.</p>
<p>Somewhere in Los Angeles there”&#x2122;s a burglar who”&#x2122;s made off with more than he”&#x2122;s bargained for”¦<i>a maharajah”&#x2122;s curse</i>.  Somebody stole into the Zelda Apartments in March of 1941 and there into the room of Mrs. F. S. Tintoff, making off with a 400 year-old ring that held two large stones, a ruby and an emerald, surrounded by small diamonds.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3151/2726620001_e3c8a3d0ec_o.gif" alt="DeathCurse!" height="117" width="575"></p>
<p>“It was given to me by my husband, a jeweler, who purchased it from a maharajah.  The ring formerly adorned an East India princess, and was supposed to have been given a mysterious Oriental curse which would bring death to the person who stole it,”&#157; said Mrs. Tintoff.    The burglar took other jewelry which with the ring had a value of $560 ($8,196 USD2007), and two other tenants in the apartment building reported similartly burgled jewelry losses to police, but nothing thereof with a curse upon”&#x2122;t.  The Tintoff ring thus joins other bloodstained jewels of the East, like the <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/science/article2935508.ece" title="Dehlicious" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dehli Purple Sapphire</a>, the <a href="http://www.underworldtales.com/hope.htm" title="eyeforaneye" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stolen</a>-from-the-Eye-of-Sita <a href="http://www.pbs.org/treasuresoftheworld/a_nav/hope_nav/hnav_level_2/level2_pitch_curse_hopfrm.html" title="abandonhope" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hope</a> <a href="http://www.pbs.org/treasuresoftheworld/a_nav/hope_nav/main_hopfrm.html" title="cantwejustgiveitback" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Diamond</a> and the similarly snatched <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/4262862.stm" title="orlovofmoney" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black Orlov</a>.  And that deadly ring of <a href="http://www.unsolvedmysteries.com/usm352194.html" title="verysheik" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Valentino</a>.</p>
<p>Did our housebreaker lose this cursed thing to the ages as he writhed in some forlorn torment somewhere?  Were his last days exactly like <a href="http://www.vnn.org/editorials/ET0204/ET22-7278.html" title="justatypicalweekonbunkerhill" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this</a>?  Or perhaps the curse was purely <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article1596823.ece" title="curseofthelawyers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">legalistic</a>. </p>
<p>What, or who, is Zelda?  Zelda La Chat (née Keil) was born in 1870, arriving in Los Angeles some time in the 90s.  She builds the eponymous Zelda, a modest bargeboard affair at the southwest corner of <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=401+S+Grand+Ave,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90071&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=69.738802,113.203125&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=34.052819,-118.252652&amp;spn=0.009138,0.013819&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr" title="401SG" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fourth and Grand</a>, here, about 1904:</p>

She lives therein until she dies of cerebral hemorrhage in 1926; she leaves an estate valued at $300,000 ($3,521,554 USD2007).</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3146/2730395798_6552405280_o.gif" alt="baronesstodust" align="left" height="239" width="250">Zelda wasn”&#x2122;t the only wealthy woman to die in the Zelda–Baroness Rosa von Zimmerman, who with her husband the Baron were second only to Krupps when to it came to weapons manufacturing for various Teutonic scraps, lived at the Zelda and died there, an alien enemy, in 1917, leaving Rosamond Castle, on fourteen acres, <a href="http://www.pasadenacal.com/architectural_tours/Oak_Knoll.html" title="pasadenafu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">across</a> from the Huntington Hotel; eleven acres in Beverly Hills; and thirty-four acres in the Palisades near Santa Monica; and about $2.5million in mortgages, bonds and securities.  Nine year-old Beatrice Denton, to whom Baroness von Zimmerman was benefactress, was supposed to be a beneficiary of the estate, but the Baroness never got around to those formalities.  Foundling Beatrice became once again an orphan and was likely returned to the asylum from which she was plucked.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3131/2726620093_eb0dbe667a_o.gif" alt="assaultsuccessor" align="left" height="111" width="429">Yes, there&#8217;s never a lack of excitement at the Zelda. Take by example the May 1916 discharge of Zelda”&#x2122;s porter George “an erratic Japanese”&#157; Nakamoto. Having been sacked by La Chat, and replaced by one K. Kitagawa, Nakamoto saw fit to return to the Zelda to seek out his successor. There was Kitagawa, crouched low, tacking down oilcloth in a cubbyhole beneath a stairway; Nakamoto grabbed a riveting hammer and struck him repeatedly on the head, injuring his skull, and sending him to Receiving hospital in critical condition.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3287/2726615643_ed65db3e35_o.gif" alt="damestoo" align="right" height="218" width="257">And then there was the night of March 10, 1939, when vice squads in Los Angeles in Beverly Hills came down on bookmaking establishments; seventeen were arrested, including James Adams, 48; George Taylor, 24; James Roberts, 26; Mrs. Agnes Meyers, 36, and Yvonne Lucas, 21, whom Central Vice took offense to the making of book in an apartment at the Zelda. (Interestingly, across Hollywood and Beverly Hills, the pinched bookmakers more often than not had names like Murray Oxhorn and Morris Levine and Saul Abrams and Joseph Blumenthal; could our Zelda perchance have been a bit”¦<i>restricted</i>?)</p>
<p>Postwar Zelda was full of fun too. Joseph M. Marcelino, 21, was just another ex-Marine who worked in a box factory. When he got nabbed on October 4, 1950, while burglarizing an apartment in the Gordon at 618 West 4th, he copped to having set fire to the Zelda, aflame at that very moment. He admitted as well to torching another hotel at 322 South Spring. He was freed without bail pending a psychiatric examination. But come April, when he broke into a factory at 1013 Santa Barbara Ave. and stole company checks, which he made payable to himself and cashed, the police came knocking.<br>
<img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3258/2727440112_6a357b4591_o.gif" alt="andforgery" height="101" width="440">Marcelino had also attempted to lift a safe and had lost part of his fingernail in the process–the cops found they had the perfect match.</p>
<p>But the winds of change blew foul in 1954. Sure, people waved their arms and preached the evils of gingerbread ornament and its relationship to tuberculosis, but when you came right down to it, <i>The Hill impeded traffic flow</i>. A new project, known as the 4th Street Cut, began that Summer, involving a 687-foot viaduct shooting eastward from the Harbor Freeway, carrying four lanes of one-way traffic above Figureora and Flower, then biting into the hill and passing beneath bridges at Hope and Grand before dipping down into the business district. Through the early 1950s there was much controversy over this plan–proponents of a tunnel argued that a cut would “hopelessly bisect”&#157; Bunker Hill. What they didn”&#x2122;t realize was that soon enough, there”&#x2122;d be no Bunker Hill to bisect.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3041/2726620439_b5047b79ff_o.gif" alt="whyaduck" height="476" width="575"></p>
<p>
Fourth Street, in becoming a cut, and Grand, in becoming a bridge, meant one thing: the surrounding buildings would have to go. And so they did. The Zelda was razed in August of 1954:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3121/2726619019_ae047e4026_o.gif" alt="demotime" height="414" width="575"></p>
<p>Seen being demo”&#x2122;d next to the Zelda is the Gordon at 618 West 4th (you remember, the place Marcelino was nabbed in in ”&#x2122;50); the Gordon, the Bronx at 624 and the La Belle at 630 West 4th were all torn down to make way for the Cut–a trio built by the sons of Dr. <a href="/node/133" title="DrJohn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John C. Zahn</a>.</p>
<p>All this brought a twinge of regret to Percy Howell, the veteran city appraiser who spent two years tramping the Hill, working out fair payments for displaced property owners.  Howell remembered his young bachelor days on Bunker Hill back in 1909, when he moved into the Zelda, “batching it”&#157; with three other gay blades.   “I never dreamed then,”&#157; said Howell, “that I would live to see the day when I condemned the Zelda for the city.”&#157;<br>

<p>The 4th Street Cut opened May 1, 1956.</p>

<p>Another shot of the viaduct (I know, why-a no chicken?) ca. 1973, during  erection of <a href="http://www.you-are-here.com/los_angeles/bank_america.html" title="youdownwithSPP" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Security Pacific Plaza</a>. </p>

<p>For twenty-five years after Zelda”&#x2122;s demolition, nothing could stem the march of progress:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3031/2726621089_a6605dbb4a_o.gif" alt="unstoppable!" height="517" width="400"></p>
<p>It has filled in now, to be fair.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3216/2727444870_b817aabfe9_o.gif" alt="4thGrandaerial" height="322" width="575"></p>

<p>And so goes Zelda La Chat, her Zelda, and 4th Street, though all we have to show for the former glory of 401 South Grand is the pointy backside of <a href="http://www.you-are-here.com/los_angeles/mellon_bank.html" title="MellonHeads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">400 South Hope</a>.</p>

<p>That the Moore Cliff has glorious views, no one can debate.  From her <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=121+S+Hill+St,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90012&amp;sll=34.055397,-118.24688&amp;sspn=0.009031,0.012853&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=34.055237,-118.246601&amp;spn=0.009031,0.012853&amp;z=16&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=34.053907,-118.247022&amp;panoid=ijBrI7ccuLhqAJClemzBNQ" title="121sh" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lofty perch</a> sixty feet above Hill Street, midway between First and Second, she gazes over the business district, and every room commands a panorama extending to Boyle Heights.  But her grand position is also her undoing; since she was built in aught-four, her inhabitants have had to trek up that dang”&#x2122;d winding six-story staircase set into the retaining wall.  Even Dr. S. G. Moore, who apparently added <i>cliff</i> to his eponymised hotel just so you”&#x2122;d remember how high you were, has tired of scaling the thing.  No view can compensate for the loss of revenue occasioned by those with an aversion to shlepping.<br>
<a href="http://bigorangelandmarks.blogspot.com/2008/04/no-129-leslie-residence.html" title="BOL" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><br>
Dennis and Farwell</a> were <a href="http://www.kimberlycrest.org/" title="kiimberly" target="_blank" rel="noopener">veteran</a> architects–and what”&#x2122;s more of a no brainer, in a rapidly growing city, than adding stories to a structure?  D&amp;F designed the Moore Cliff, and now here comes Moore again, wanting to convert her from a four-story apartment building to a nine-story hotel.  But don”&#x2122;t add these floors to the top, says Moore, massaging his aching  feet–add them to the bottom.<br>
<img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3022/2679389898_558dcb84e9_o.jpg" alt="tolet" height="56" width="267"><br>
No problem, say Dennis and Farwell.  All we need to do is remove a body of earth fifty-five feet in width by sixty feet in height, and fifty feet in depth.  This will stretch under the present building which we”&#x2122;ll prop up until our five story steel-and-brick structure, with a façade to resemble the one up on the hill we designed eight years ago, gets slid in there.  Dress the new lobby in mahagony-stained birch, throw on an iron marquise, and there you have your nine-story hotel, right there at terra firma, all blessed as it is with sidewalks and rail lines.  <br>
<img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3108/2678571605_1a757eca63_o.gif" alt="asitwillappear" height="676" width="575"><br>
Everyone”&#x2122;s quite excited that the length of Hill south of the tunnel is bursting with plans.  (A stone”&#x2122;s throw from Hill up Second, Braun”&#x2122;s ten-story reinforced <a href="/taxonomy_menu/6/133" title="Northern" target="_blank" rel="noopener">concrete hotel</a> is pouring fourndations.)  Judge Stephens intends to erect a substantial building of brick and steel just to the south of the Moore Cliff; and plans are afoot to build on the southwest corner of First and Hill, where a large cut was made years ago.  “It is freely predicted that all of the frontage on the west side of Hill street will have been reduced to grade level within the next year or two.”&#157;  </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3237/2678571093_a41a23752d_o.gif" alt="MC1932" align="right" height="298" width="415">What do you notice here, from this 1932 image of the Moore Cliff?  </p>
<p>It didn”&#x2122;t happen.</p>
<p>(Nor do we witness Judge Stephens”&#x2122; proposed structure; no-one ever built on the SW corner of First &amp; Hill, either.)</p>

<p>As can be seen, the Moore Cliff&#8217;s cliff has been almost, but not quite, brought down to grade level.  (The tunnels up Hill were flattened something fierce, though.)  <br>

		<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2254/2660612112_3f255d818e_o.gif" alt="Marcella" height="592" width="575">Today we discuss The Marcella, who once flaunted her classical order on Flower (she is Italian, please be advised the C in her name is not pronounced <i>s</i> as in <i>sell</i>, but like <i>ch</i> as in <i>chin</i>).  See how her name beckons, proud but not haughty, from her entablature?  She wants to take you in and protect you under that great cornice with her large corbels.  Despite her imposing presence, she is warm, and welcoming; the wide porches bespeak grace, and the timberframe vernacular on the bays coo <i>cozy by the fire lad, there”&#x2122;s good feelings in mortise and tenon</i>.  </p>
<p>But don”&#x2122;t speak of  fire.  Fire struck the Marcella in October of 1912, sending well-to-do ladies like Mrs. L. M. Harvey to Pacific Hospital after having leapt from upper stories.  Other occupants hustled (stricken with panic; see below) and scantily attired into the street.  Marcella owner C. F. Holland states he”&#x2122;s looking at $3,000 ($65,983 USD2007) in damages, $2,000 to the rugs and furniture alone.  <br>

It is reported that a man was seen running from the building a few minutes before the fire broke out.  The storeroom, where the fire began, was not locked.  The mystery is never solved but Marcella, stout of bay and stalwart of column, cannot be burned away.  She perseveres.<br>
<img loading="lazy" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2001/2660612342_da8059f7d9_o.gif" alt="Cometomother" height="820" width="575"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Marcella is a building so lovely she attracts only the comeliest of patrons.  She is home to Miss May Long, a lass so fetching that when in May of 1913 she turned her attentions to one Earl G. Horton, he is gunned down by another suitor outside of his apartment house near <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=1129+W+Temple+St,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90012&amp;sll=34.068214,-118.251193&amp;sspn=0.00855,0.013304&amp;layer=c&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=34.067841,-118.251235&amp;spn=0.00855,0.013304&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr&amp;cbll=34.063953,-118.25192&amp;panoid=GHaKiWGCNCAnGNrIWbCV1Q" title="shooting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Temple &amp; Victor</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jealousy over a woman causes upset <i>again</i> at the Marcella on October 25 of 1922 when Emergency Patrolman Claude Coffrin went to visit Mrs. Tillie Smith in her Marcella apartment.  Not long after Coffrin&#8217;s ingress, there appeared Emergency Patrolman Anthony Kazokas and a civilian, Joe Cummins.  Kazokas had loaned Cummins his revolver and badge to settle his romantic score with Coffrin over Tillie.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3222/2661876479_09a095e2ae_o.gif" alt="nothingbuttroubleItellya" height="117" width="488"></p>
<p>Coffrin and Cummins fought, and Coffrin gained control of the gun; he phoned the Detective Bureau and over came officers Nickens and Ellis.  Cummins at that point grabbed the gun back from Coffrin and stuck it in Nickens”&#x2122; side, and Patrolman Kazokas jumped on Detective Ellis.  Ellis brained Kazokas out cold with the butt of his gun, but Nickens ended up shooting Cummins through the neck.  </p>
<p>The lovely Mrs. Smith was arrested on violation of parole; she had been sentenced on the 18th to pay $50 and spend thirty days in jail–suspended–for “social vagrancy”&#157;.  Apparently, quality of young lady was beginning to decline at the Marcella.<br>

Other upstanding members of society to grace the Marcella”&#x2122;s rooms were the Jacksons, of whom you read all about <a href="/node/118" title="NISA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. <br>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And remember <a href="/iwantolive" title="idont" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Barbara Graham</a>?  What helped send Barbara to the chair was hubby Henry”&#x2122;s testimony on the witness stand.  Her last-ditch alibi was that she and Henry were together that night of March 9, 1953–but Henry testified he had already moved out and was living with his mother”¦at the Marcella.  (A mere two blocks down from the Lancaster, scene of Baxter Shorter&#8217;s abduction.)</p>
<p>Little Tommy Graham, now five, was living in the Marcella in 1957 when Wanger Pictures gave him $1000 for filming his executed mother”&#x2122;s life story.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fire again struck the Marcella, this time in 1962, and this time it meant business.  On March 30 a blaze razed the upper two stories of the structure.  Twelve fire units quelled the blaze in half an hour; She of 223 South Flower vanished from memory soon afterward.</p>
<p>Here we are looking north on Flower through the intersection of Third, 1965.  See the little Victorian, left center?  The Marcella was just on the other side of that.<br>

Today Flower Street makes a sharp turn between Third and Second to avoid the Bunker Hill Towers.  The Marcella stood just on the other side of this pool:</p>

<p>Interesting, and, what, perhaps a little unnerving, but certainly instructive, to consider that the image that began this post, and the one immediately above, were taken from the same spot.</p>

<p>”¦so now it”&#x2122;s time to sew things up, recounting a collection of other Dome-flavored contretemps:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3188/2639344771_89d3266cbc_o.gif" alt="CookFight" align="left" height="172" width="227"><b><br>
April 7, 1940</b>.  Mike Scaiola, 29, and Rocco Spagnuolo, 35, both cooks, were roomies at the Dome. Over what they argued in their Domeroom is lost to time; all that”&#x2122;s known is what Scaiola later told the cops–during a scuffle he saw the .32 automatic protruding from Spagnuolo”&#x2122;s shirt and attempted to wrest it from him.  Oldest story in the world:  accidental discharge, someone takes one in the chest, and Spagnuolo”&#x2122;s DOA at Georgia Street Receiving.  </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3032/2640171664_4b3a38e1ba_o.gif" alt="jackiejailed" align="right" height="180" width="216"><b><br>
September 18, 1941</b>.  Mrs. Cleo (Jackie) Wooten, 19, was a plucky gal, but take this as a warning:  having pluck in spades gets the FBI involved.  Cleo was visiting friends in Cunningham, Kan. for some time and was there driving the car owned by Eddie Palzo of that city.  He had no objection to her driving the car around Cunningham, but swore out a felony complaint when the Dome resident decided to Dome home.  She was picked up at Third and Figueroa when an officer noticed the license on his stolen car list. </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3058/2639476665_d10268e4e7_o.gif" alt="JoeSlasher" align="left" height="199" width="217"><b><br>
July 4, 1942</b>.  The character of Dome resident Joe Barron, 28, cook (another cook?  Too many cooks really do spoil the pot), did not reflect well on the Dome”&#x2122;s nobility.  He was strolling down Fifth Street and passed between one William O. Smith, 37, and Smith”&#x2122;s 21 year-old wife Dorothy when he elected to make an off-color remark to the wife.  That didn”&#x2122;t go over well with Mr. Smith, a recent transplant from Arkansas, who slashed Barron”&#x2122;s throat, severing an artery.  Luckily, Dorothy instructed William to press his thumb on the artery to stanch the flow of blood, and they hauled Barron into a room at 107 E. Fifth until medical aid could be summoned.  Barron survived, we trust, wiser and more gentelmanly.</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3095/2639344229_08665c444d_o.gif" alt="LeonasPurse" align="right" height="102" width="172"><b><br>
December 21, 1942</b>.  Mrs. Leona Smith was followed home from a café last November 7, only to have her purse snatched–a purse containing $1600 in cash and checks and $4800 worth of jewelry ($6400=$89,216 USD2007).  After a month of searching by cops based on Leona”&#x2122;s description of the man and his car, they finally popped Clifford Allen Payne, 32, at the Dome.  He took them to the 3500 block of Helms in Culver where he dug up a glass jar containing the checks and jewelry.  The real mystery is what she was doing with that sort of booty in her purse.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3259/2640171574_f87b21c32f_o.gif" alt="afbarshoot" align="left" height="62" width="204"><b>March 11, 1961</b>.  Alfred Carrillo, 33, was a Dome resident in good standing who had the bad luck to be sitting in a bar at 301 South Hill Street one early Friday morning.  Victor F. Jimenez, 26, unemployed truck driver, shot Alfred and then drove off, later to be arrested at his home.  (The bar at 301 South Hill, by the way, was the bar at the base of Angels Flight–seen here with Lon Chaney Jr. in the 1956 outing <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/indestructible_man" title="IM" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>Indestructible Man</i></a>🙂</p>

<p>
That”&#x2122;s what we have for now.  Can”&#x2122;t promise it”&#x2122;s the last of it, as tales and details may still bubble up from the cracked core of time.  What about you?  Remember your great aunt Nell?  The one you socked away at Shady Pines?  (The rest home, not the cemetery.)   She may harbor descriptions of devious Dome debauchery from back in the day.  Go find out before you have to shift Shady Pines.</p>

But L. H. Mills and J. G. Talbott have come along and said <i>fooey</i>!  We reject these in their totality and all they represent, and with that utterly destroyed the foundations and have, in the style of all that is great and noble of the year 1912, set out to build from the ground up the finest apartment hotel available.</p>

<p>
The building is 75&#215;176”&#x2122; and contains 160 rooms.  Despite its vaguely<br>
French Renaissance air, it is named the Nottinghamshire-evoking<br>
<i>Sherwood</i>.</p>

<p>The lobby is 50&#215;41”&#x2122;, finished in mahogany, its inglenook containing a large fireplace.  Each Sherwood apartment contains a private dressing room with built-in dresser and mirror.  Whereas law stipulates the minimum space for apartment living rooms as 120 square feet, the Sherwood&#8217;s are 190; where the legal minimum for hallways is three feet six inches, Mills and Talbott see that theirs will be six feet across.  Just because.  <br>

<p>In June of 1915, the Sherwood hosted the wedding of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0366742/" title="thegreatPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">P. C. Hartigan</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0366473/" title="bestillmybeatinghart" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Peggy Hart</a>, in the apartments of their pal, Sherwoodian Mrs. Dick Ferris, and in the company of Judge Summerfield and many a jolly Hollywood pal.<br>

Soon after, however, the quality of Hollywood Type there began to decline.  Even in our TMZ era that abjures accomplishment and rewards reprobation, dag, that <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0941745/" title="HLW" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Helen Lee Worthing</a> gave society a run for its money.  And surely set Sherwood tongues a-wagging.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3118/2620005308_42339312b2_o.gif" alt="HLW" align="right" height="325" width="250">Worthing was a statuesque Bostonian-by-way-of-Kentucky who”&#x2122;d become a Ziegfeld Follies girl–the toast of New York, and lady-friend of a New York mayor, it was said.  Darling of the rotogravure section, it was then on to Hollywood, where she made pictures galore while at the same time gracing nightly Ziegfeld”&#x2122;s well-known assemblage of pulchritude.</p>
<p>She”&#x2122;d always had a tempestuous time of it”¦in 1922, after a Hearst paper described in detail Worthing&#8217;s New York catfight with another chorus girl–including a cartoon depicting the biting and clawing–she elected to end her life by swallowing bichloride of mercury.  Ended up in Bellevue.</p>
<p>Once in Hollywood she made the papers in more light-hearted ways; in 1925 she drove her car off a cliff and from there atop the roof of a house in Whitley Heights.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3025/2620005226_37bfba4d52_o.gif" alt="hlw2" align="left" height="350" width="245"><br>
But her career continued to blossom; Mary Pickford called her the most beautiful woman in the world, and  <a href="http://www.illustration-house.com/bios/fisher_bio.html" title="HF" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Harrison Fisher</a> adjudged her the most beautiful profile in America.  In 1926–the year she starred with Barrymore in <i>Don Juan</i>–she demanded $100,000 from a perfume company that had used her image.</p>
<p>But 1927 was to change all that.  In April she was the victim of a violent beating, administered by an intruder, which left her with a broken nose, knocked-out tooth and discolored eyes.  And five days of delirium.  Her colored maid called Dr. Eugene Nelson, noted Negro physician, to see after her famous employer.  </p>
<p>And it was love!  They threw society”&#x2122;s strictures aside (it was still forty years before <i>Loving v. Virginia</i> and eighty til <i>Seal n</i>”&#x2122;<i> Heidi</i>) and set about on a whirlwind romance that resulted in a secret Tijuana wedding in June.  The fact that there was no intruder, and Nelson had to care for someone in a mad fit of drunkenness (or, more precisely, a drunken fit of madness) should have given him pause.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3241/2620005398_7fc74ebaff_o.jpg" alt="helooksasblackasIdo" align="left" height="241" width="135">They keep the wedding secret but is revealed to the world late in 1929, after their estrangement becomes known.  His philandering, cruelty, jealously, and threats of confining her to some sort of institution are apparently too much for her.  </p>
<p>In 1930 she returns from a New York “Neurological Institute”&#157; where she”&#x2122;s been treated for&#8230;the blues.  She is outted by a reporter as being shacked up at the Mayfair, and she moves into an unnamed apartment-house; likely The Sherwood, as she turns up there in short order.</p>
<p>Divorce proceedings stretch through the early 30s: she complains that he beats her and drugs her and forces her outside wearing only her negligee; he replies that they didn”&#x2122;t fulfill Mexican residential requirements and, as they”&#x2122;re not therefore legally wed, doesn”&#x2122;t owe her monthly monies.  By November 1932 she”&#x2122;s hallucinating that objects are being thrown at her, and is threatening suicide, and lands in the psychopathic ward of General Hospital.  The marriage is annulled in January 1933.</p>
<p>In June of 1933 she disappears from an eastbound Santa Fe train–it is assumed she jumped, or fell.  A three day search ensues.  Turns out she just got off at Pasadena, abandoning her bags and tickets.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3024/2621722712_742b1486dc_o.gif" alt="sherwoodarrest" align="right" height="140" width="252">On August 16, 1933, the coppers come to The Sherwood to collect Helen Lee Worthing on violation of her parole to the psychopathic department.  In a statement from her psych ward bed at General Hospital, Helen declared that she had been living quietly in her apartment, attempting to increase her income by writing poetry and short stories.  “I can”&#x2122;t understand who would complain and have me returned here,”&#157; she said.  “I have only been trying to get a start on my own ability.  Incidentally, I have fallen in love with a man who has been typing my poetry, but that has nothing to do with this.”&#157;</p>
<p>If only the story could end with her returning to the Sherwood, marrying the typist, and living long enough to move into the Bunker Hill Towers.  But it was not to be.  </p>
<p>In 1935 she is arrested on a drunk charge in Venice, and can”&#x2122;t come up with the $5 bail, or even the pals to post the bail for her; she spend ten days in Lincoln Heights jail.<br>
<img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3161/2621933808_6a4087d36c_o.gif" alt="error" height="400" width="143"><br>
In September 1935 she”&#x2122;s living in the <a href="http://www.childrensinstitute.org/about/history.php" title="BSL" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Big Sister League</a> Guest Home, when she again takes poison, this time over unrequited love.<br>
<img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3074/2620900207_4463acdc87_o.gif" alt="nursestrangle" height="500" width="283"><br>
In 1939 she”&#x2122;s sentenced to five months in County on a narcotics charge–passing forged morphine scrips and carrying a hypo in her purse.  In 1940 she”&#x2122;s given a year for the same MO.  (Interestingly, while in stir, going about her duties as a trusty in the woman”&#x2122;s ward of County, only three flights below was her ex-husband Dr. Eugene Nelson, awaiting his murder trial–not only was he practicing without a license, having lost that–but he killed a girl while aborting her fetus.)</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3022/2621723088_d35189fb00_o.gif" alt="checkup" height="339" width="500"><br>
In October 1942 she”&#x2122;s popped for public drunkenness outside a downtown roominghouse; she fails to appear in court for her hearing, but sends a note:  “I am leaving the State.  I do not feel I can get fair treatment in California courts.”&#157;  Needless to say, she does not leave the state.  Radio car officers were called to the scene of her beating by some “boyfriend”&#157; in her Centennial Street apartment in April 1944, and took her to Georgia Street Receiving where she was treated for half-inch laceration on the chin and a 1+1/2 inch cut on the back of her head; she does not press charges.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3280/2621015543_5c0ca25b9d_o.jpg" alt="uhoh" align="right" height="58" width="217">In 1946 she”&#x2122;s found downed and dazed at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=W+Sunset+Blvd+%26+Portia+St,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90026&amp;sll=34.076585,-118.254368&amp;sspn=0.008549,0.012445&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=34.076585,-118.254368&amp;spn=0.008549,0.012445&amp;t=h&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr" title="thebeginningoftheend" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Portia and Sunset</a>, and examination fails to find injury or illness.  She talks vaguely of trying to obtain rest by “self-hypnosis.”&#157;  Uh-huh.</p>
<p>Some would see this as a red flag; others as the checkered flag&#8230;the race is over.  In any event, people will sit in the stands waiting for a spectacular crash.  Most of the time, the car sputters and dies.  It”&#x2122;s just a matter of time, now.</p>
<p>August 25, 1948.  She dies of barbiturate poisoning, in a tiny house (1062 North Serrano, since wiped out by the Hollywood Freeway) surrounded by expensive scrapbooks bulging with clippings from her golden age.  Inside were penciled notes:  “I can”&#x2122;t stand another straw–it would be too much.”&#157;  Say hello next time you”&#x2122;re in <a href="http://www.inglewoodparkcemetery.org/" title="youdownwithIPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Inglewood</a>.</p>

<p>The Sherwood is now occupied roughly by the back side of the Welton Becket&#8217;s 1981 Mellon First Business Bank, and some miniaturized version of a street called “Hope Place.”&#157;  <br>

For anyone who may gripe that the majority of this page deals more with Hollywood than it does with Bunker Hill, believe me, brother, this isn”&#x2122;t the last you”&#x2122;ve heard of The Sherwood.</p>

The two collared ringleaders were on their way to the station house when one of the youngsters tucked a lock of long hair under his cap”¦he being Miss Juanita Stuart, fourteen, of the Rossmere.  She protested tearfully when her mother was instructed by officers to burn the costume of khaki trousers, flannel shirt and boy”&#x2122;s sweater, and to keep the young lady attired in feminine apparel only thereafter.</p>
<p><b>July 1, 1927.</b>  William Barrett, Rossmerian, had been arrested at the hotel by officers on Volstead violations and entered into evidence was one large bottle of gin.  At Barrett”&#x2122;s trial the prosecuting attorney sought to clinch a conviction by producing said bottle, but, like a reversed wedding at Cana, a police property room at LAPD will turn gin into water.  </p>

<p>Barrett went back to the Rossmere a free man, thankful to the police for working a miracle.</p>

Bitters, 82, a former shoplifter by trade, decided on September 5 of this year to stop eating.  The fourteen-year resident of the Rossmere simply found life “no longer worth living,”&#157; which is reasonable enough (moreover recently-assassinated Gandhi had made fasting fashionable).  But Bitters was descended upon by members of the Community Chest and the Salvation Army”&#x2122;s Golden Agers Club, who bundled him up and trundled him off to General Hosptial for psychiatric examination.  </p>

Elena Bravo had warned her little Martha, seven, against playing on the third floor fire escape, but Martha didn”&#x2122;t listen and tumbled off, only to be caught by Mrs. Max Casados”&#x2122; ground-floor clothesline.  The child suffered a compound arm fracture, a less lamentable situation than another hotel would have afforded.</p>

And after his sprinkler-like artery-opening anointing act, he beat down a door and chased his wife–she carrying their nine-month-old baby–and her parents into the street outside the Rossmere with a butcher knife.  When the cops finally arrived at First and Hope they found Morales inside, having slashed his throat with a razor blade.  He was taken to the prison ward at General Hospital.</p>

<p>It”&#x2122;s April 25, 1957, and a demolition crew is hard at work tearing down “an ancient frame dwelling”&#157; at First and Hope streets. Charles Ousley, 25, is standing in the bed of a dump truck when an arrow whistles by. He alerts John Trott, 30, crew foreman, who picks up the feathered shaft and gazes upward.</p>
<p>In a third-floor window of the <a title="rossmere" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=700+W+1st+St,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90012&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=60.376022,108.984375&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=34.05817,-118.249884&amp;spn=0.00784,0.013304&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rossmere Apartments</a> across the street, he saw a man with a five-foot bow.<br>

		<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3126/2561831767_425be12224_o.gif" alt="bunkerair" height="412" width="500">The history of Bunker Hill could not be written without mention of a man who stood up to face the foe.  Who fought City Hall; who fought the law, and sure, the law won.   But let”&#x2122;s remember the man.  Firebrand.  Gadfly.  Babcock.</p>
<p>It”&#x2122;s 1951, and we”&#x2122;re faced with Proposition C, which sounded just <i>swell</i>:  clear the city”&#x2122;s slum areas and replace “ramshackle”&#157; tenements with modern apartments.  The Times ran large pieces urging the voters to back C, citing a litany of political, business and union leaders supporting the measure (veterans”&#x2122; organizations termed the measure “a solution of a vital civic problem in the American way”&#157;).</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3187/2561698214_4c31b4a0b1_o.gif" alt="poopC" align="right" height="178" width="242">But one fellow didn”&#x2122;t think the idea so all-American–owner of <a href="/theDome" title="thedome" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Dome</a>, president of the Bunker Hill Property Owners Association, Frank Babcock.  The Association met before the election and passed a resolution announcing their opposition to Prop C (which would raze Bunker Hill, to be replaced by “12 blocks of new apartment houses”&#157;) whereby property owners would be forced to sell at condemnation prices; BHPOA also saw C as a scheme to take their property for the benefit of insurance corporations.  Be that as it may, the voters decided Proposition C was the American Way (despite the Stalinist overtones of a government taking private property) and it passed.  But you hadn”&#x2122;t heard the last of Frank Babcock.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important not to confuse our Frank Babcock with the anti-Babcock, or Babcock-Bizarro, if you will.  Henry Babcock.  Whether they”&#x2122;re related we do not know, but it does tickle the imagination to think so.  Why?  Because Henry Babcock had been involved in the wholesale demolition of Bunker Hill since 1930.  He arrived in Los Angeles from Chicago as one of William Babcock &amp; Sons, real estate valuators and consultants, to study the feasibility of the “Bigelow Plan”&#157; (C. C. Bigelow”&#x2122;s 1928 scheme for removing the Hill using hydraulic mining equipment) and how quickly a regraded Bunker Hill could be absorbed into downtown.  Henry Babcock in-a-nutshell:</p>
<div align="justify">
<img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3119/2561908161_1b76261501_o.gif" alt="babcockreport" align="right" height="400" width="160"><br>
“There is no community, it is found, that is entirely free from spots or sections that by reason of antiquated structures, topographical conditions or congestion have depreciated in value and also are having an adverse effect on adjacent areas.  This is on the principle of the spoiled apple in the barrel.  In fact, directly or indirectly, these depreciated areas threaten a bad effect on entire municipalities.<br>
“They cannot by fenced off and left to their fate.  They cannot be segregated to work out their own salvation regardless of the rest of the community.  Consequently they present a problem of concern to the entire city in which they are situated.  Naturally, the rehabilitation of blighted areas is governed entirely by the conditions involved.<br>
“In the instance of Bunker Hill the matter of topography enters largely into consideration.  Admittedly it is a traffic barrier not only for itself but for extensive and growing sections at every side of it.  Architecturally it has not kept pace with the modernly growing parts of the city.  It apparently presents a striking need for rehabilitation if it is to share in the indicated improvement in realty values.  Modern engineering methods lend themselves expeditiously to the razing of this are or any part of it and without undue interference with a natural volume of traffic with the work is under way.”&#157;
</div>
<p>Babcock, after presenting a ninety-six page report about razing and regrading Bunker Hill to the City Council, decided to stay in Los Angeles as a vice-president of the Mitchel-Brown &amp; Co. Spring-Street investment house.</p>
<p>Then, there was to be a Babcockfight.  Henry Babcock shows up again in 1951 as a consulting engineer for Proposition C.  He outdoes the CRA by drawing up plans for <i>thirty-seven</i> thirteen-story apartment complexes on 73 acres, four 600-car parking garages, and open paved lots for 2560 autos.  Parking and retail buildings were to be located in the center of Bunker Hill.</p>
<p>In February of 1955 Frank Babcock strolled down from his Dome to Superior Court and slapped the Community Redevelopment Agency with an injunction to block the development  (the City, and all the members of the City Council [with the exception of Edward R. Roybal, who”&#x2122;d voted against BH redevelopment] were also named as defendants). <br>
<img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3048/2561500125_c8d23b3839_o.gif" alt="councilready" align="left" height="225" width="179"><br>
Babcock asserted that the law was clear:  the CRA could only demolish blighted areas.  The structures and set-up of Bunker Hill, Babcock argued, met City ordinances”&#x2122; standards and filled the economic needs of the community, and further contended that (despite common belief and <a href="http://www.allanguthrie.co.uk/5/paul_cain.htm" title="bhnoir" target="_blank" rel="noopener">literary assertions</a> to the contrary) Bunker Hill”&#x2122;s buildings were safe for occupancy, not conducive to ill health, transmission of disease, juvenile delinquency, infant mortality or crime.  And, owner of the Dome that he was, was proud to say that landowners on the Hill were planning development of their own properties and had no need for the “aid”&#157; of 40million+ condemnation dollars in taxpayer funds.</p>
<p>By June of 1956, William T. Sesnon, armed with Henry Babcock”&#x2122;s financial, economic and architectural surveys, presented final plans to the City Council.  As required by law, there was a public hearing; Frank Babcock presented his alternate proposals–lost to time, now.  It would seem there was nothing Frank Babcock could do to stem the tide that would wash away Bunker Hill and his beloved Dome.  Until he realized that tide was suffused with <i>brea</i>.  </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3158/2562325908_a8fdc9a024_o.gif" alt="bunkerhilltea" align="right" height="175" width="221">Oil, that is.  William T. Sesnon Jr., chairman of the Community Redevelopment Agency, is an oil magnate, after all.  (&#8216;Twas he who proposed the plan to finance homes for those elderly residents who had to be relocated from Bunker Hill:  the City would drill on property bounded by <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=W+Temple+St+%26+E+Edgeware+Rd,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90026&amp;sll=34.067592,-118.256364&amp;sspn=0.008994,0.013304&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=34.067592,-118.254647&amp;spn=0.008994,0.013304&amp;t=h&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr" title="oilfield" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Temple</a>, Beverly, Union and Edgeware–one of LA”&#x2122;s oldest oilfields–and the senior-citizen property owners would receive a one-sixth royalty interest with which they could pay their new rents.)  And Sesnon wanted Bunker Hill for its mineral rights, you see.  And Babcock could prove it were he able to inspect the Agency”&#x2122;s books and records, a request he”&#x2122;d been repeatedly denied.  On June 23, 1958 Babcock demanded the issuance of a writ of mandate to compel the agency to allow him access.  If the idea of oil beneath Bunker Hill sounds nutty, it”&#x2122;s not; but we won”&#x2122;t go into our petroleum reservoir wherefores here.  Babcock should have restrained himself when he charged that the City Council was in on the conspiracy, though.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3079/2562385432_288c142f94_o.gif" alt="thelash" height="63" width="355"></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3124/2561579449_b68afa3eaa_o.gif" alt="ohnoyoudidn" align="left" height="168" width="205">This prompted some strong words on the Chamber floor, where the next day Sesnon himself stood and said in part:  “I regret the necessity of speaking but the action filed yesterday makes it unavoidable.  These charges are irresponsible, malicious, vindictive and utterly false.  No member of the Council ever entered into such a deal.  It is an outrage that we have to face such publicity and I completely resent such statements.”&#157;</p>
<p>Alas, that”&#x2122;s the last we hear of Frank Babcock.  Henry Babcock is mentioned one more time, in August of 1958, testifying before the City Council about the estimated value of a regraded Hill.</p>
<p>The Babcocks go on to watch as the CRA, bit by bit, commandeers umpteen millions from City coffers, displaces 9,000 people, and eventually gobbles up 136 acres.  In the Autumn of 1961 the first CRA-demo”&#x2122;d building goes down–the Hillcrest.  Frank Babcock”&#x2122;s Dome stands proud until she burns in the Summer of ”&#x2122;64.  </p>
<p>Henry Babcock”&#x2122;s city of apartment buildings on the Hill never quite materializes the way he planned it.</p>

<p>Walter Jackson gave A. J. Munn due pause, back in mid-aught four, when he approached Munn seeking a position at Munn”&#x2122;s hotel.   (You can”&#x2122;t be too careful when hiring for an establishment that bears your own name, e.g., the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=430+S+Olive+St,+90013&amp;sll=34.051611,-118.251858&amp;sspn=0.009031,0.014591&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=34.051611,-118.251858&amp;spn=0.009031,0.014591&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr" title="munnH" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hotel Munn</a>.)  You see, Munn detected liquor on Jackson”&#x2122;s breath, but, some highly-placed hoteliers had recommended Jackson, so Munn engaged him with and on the distinct understanding that Jackson would foreswear liquor and gambling.  Any On Bunker Hill reader knows the story won”&#x2122;t end there.</p>
<p>Jackson was a gay and debonair fellow, and quickly rose to the rank of manager.  But Mr. Munn began to have his doubts about Jackson as the hotel took in less and less money. Jackson proved to be a skilled tactician (and statistician) and evaded detection; it didn”&#x2122;t help Munn that the Jackson-hypnotized hotel residents declared they still owed accounts, when in fact they had paid them and secretly held receipts signed by Jackson.  <br>
<img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3281/2532589333_279379af52_o.jpg" alt="hotelmunn" height="246" width="400"><br>
Jackson”&#x2122;s undoing came in the form of an Examiner reporter, resident of the Munn, who went against the touts at the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Ascot+Ave,+Los+Angeles,+CA&amp;sll=33.995501,-118.2516&amp;sspn=0.018075,0.029182&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=34.002866,-118.249969&amp;spn=0.036146,0.058365&amp;z=14&amp;iwloc=addr" title="Ascot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ascot</a>, and skipped town after losing everything.  (The Ascot Park was a one-mile oval track for horse racing built in 1904, and closed in 1910 after betting on horses became illegal in California.)</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3283/2538333439_005cec5c65_o.gif" alt="ascot" height="172" width="400"></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2406/2538333573_c814d944f9_o.gif" alt="ascotstands" height="200" width="400"></p>
<p>The Hotel Munn held a claim against the reporter for $48.15 ($1,094 USD2007) and Munn wrote the reporter”&#x2122;s mother in the East.  After a long and patient wait, he wrote again.  <i>Oh no</i>, said the mother, <i>I immediately mailed you $50 to cancel the obligation</i>.</p>
<p>Thereafter Munn began digging in earnest and found someone to whom Jackson had issued a receipt for the money–uncredited in the books.  With said evidence of cash appropriation, Jackson was summarily fired.  Proprietor Munn was able to come up with shortage of about $100, and Mrs. Jackson, ever faithful, wired her own mother for the money.  Then Munn agreed to take a note from Jackson for $200, due in thirty days and stipulating that no criminal prosecution would result provided the shortage did not exceed the amount of the note.<br>
<img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3201/2533418826_3db0a9ea48_o.gif" alt="hotterthanapeppersprout" height="500" width="222"><br>
Alas, as the matter became public around the hotel, a dozen or more guests came forward with receipts for money paid that had not been credited, and the shortage quickly jumped above $600 ($13,680 USD2007).  Jackson is presumably less gay and debonair behind bars in County this morning.</p>
