Showing someone this Belmont post and they asked of the lobby image, above, whatâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s that in the glass over the door?  Good question.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3382/3242682210_b082b16377_o.gif&quot; alt=&quot;johnglass&quot; height=&quot;190&quot; width=&quot;575&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thatâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s taken from John, that most evangelistic (and, say some, anti-Semitic and flagrantly Gnostic) of Gospels.  Itâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s 10:10, and the full passage (KJ) reads â€œThe thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy:  I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.â€ 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Interesting to wonder whether if after Belmontization, management elected to retain the wording.  (I&#039;m working on the assumption that during the Union League&#039;s short stint in ownership, they left if alone.)  Maybe Mayer removed it, maybe Mayer merely covered it over, but think of Bunker Hill, thick with thieves, there to steal, kill, and destroy, they, who needed Life, abundant Life?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The YWCA/Belmont only came down less than forty years ago.  Surely &lt;i&gt;someone&lt;/i&gt; remembers.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Some more random close-ups of the lobby, just for wild kicks. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

Any booster can write some tripe about the beauty of this place or that, and that booster could even be some &#034;blogger&#034; one hundred years in the future.  But here&#039;s a contemporary account, from the back of our YWCA lobby card above, February 1909, which clearly states that &lt;i&gt;the interior of this building is quite beautiful&lt;/i&gt;.  There.  There you have it.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3092/3241913435_4bc055ba6b_o.gif&quot; alt=&quot;belmontback&quot; height=&quot;416&quot; width=&quot;429&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It goes on to say, in true letter home to Illinois from Los Angeles fashion, &lt;i&gt;Took a long ride through the suburbs this afternoon&lt;/i&gt; (Highland Park?  West Adams?) &lt;i&gt;Orange and lemon trees loaded with fruit &lt;/i&gt;(you&#039;re darn&#039;d tootin they are) &lt;i&gt;Had dinner at a Spanish Cafe &lt;/i&gt;(and you&#039;re dan&#039;d tootin you did -- Casa Verdugo on South Spring?) and &lt;i&gt;Red pepper used in abundance&lt;/i&gt; (The Spaniard!  Will he stop at nothing?)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
