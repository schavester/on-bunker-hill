					<description><![CDATA[hello,

My Â great grandmother Bridget Ohara Fitzgerald, at one point in time ran the Touraine Apartments, Or she owned it. (I am not sure.) I cannot find any history of this, and wonder if you can help me. I would be very greatful. She died June 9th, 1948 in Los Angeles, on Green St. in those Apartments she owned.

&#160;

Thank you,

Christine Hennessy]]></description>
