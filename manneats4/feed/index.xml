					<description><![CDATA[What an interesting find! That half-rounded building shows its origins as a Simon&#039;s Drive-In. I&#039;m not good at dating cars, which might help in figuring out when this image was shot, but I believe the waitress neon shot by George Mann was on a much taller pole. So maybe both signs existed at the same time--but given the choice, who wouldn&#039;t shoot the waitress?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have a question about the Jack&#039;s Hamburger sign...I found a photo of Jack&#039;s place on Sunset Blvd. and the neon sign out front isn&#039;t like the one you have posted for the location. Wondering if the sign was changed or from a different place?  Here&#039;s the link:
