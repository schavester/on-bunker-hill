					<description><![CDATA[Hi Gordon, I&#039;m finding the history of Bunker Hill so intriguing. You mention the city&#039;s skyline, and that got me wondering, do you remember if the beautiful Eastern Columbia Building was visible from Bunker Hill when you were living there? Maybe from atop Angel&#039;s Flight or the lookout tower above that? Thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine sent me pictures of Old Los Angeles over 10 years ago, because he knew that I was born in Los Angeles. Â One picture stoped me in my tracks, and It was &#8220;The Castle&#8221;! Â I could swear I had seen it some where before and I can&#8217;t put my finger on it. Â  I have been obsessed with trying to find out who the original architect wasÂ for the floor plan lay-out was before the add-ons. Â Would you have any idea of who it is? Or who they are?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Old Los Angeles has been my muse for all my art projects while I attended the local college.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[hello,

My Â great grandmother Bridget Ohara Fitzgerald, at one point in time ran the Touraine Apartments, Or she owned it. (I am not sure.) I cannot find any history of this, and wonder if you can help me. I would be very greatful. She died June 9th, 1948 in Los Angeles, on Green St. in those Apartments she owned.

&#160;

Thank you,

Christine Hennessy]]></description>

There is a sticker in the front naming John M. Larronde, 237 Hope Street. I am assuming John sold/passed it to my great grandfather, who graduated from LA High in 1898.

My mother was born Deborah Darlene Mitchell. Her dad was Ernest Owens Chilson, son of Adah and Thearn Chilson. Is this your brother? My mother didn&#039;t really know her dad or much of his family, but I think we might be related. I hope your book is working out well. Please get back to me as you might be my mother&#039;s aunt and my great aunt.]]></description>
