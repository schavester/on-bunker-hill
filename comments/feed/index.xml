					<description><![CDATA[Hello, I grew up in Los Angeles and my sister and brotherâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s used to play in Bunker Hill. Â I remember these houses like it was yesterday! Â We never vandalized them or anything like that!! Â We always showed respect for the Beautiful homes they were... and one day they were gone  and we were so disappointed...And learning now, that they were Burnt up, just breaks my heart... I was born in 1949 and we were so poor, all we could afford was a two room tenement slum apartment for 7 of us. Â So I sure believed in the Magic Castle and that someday it would help me get out of the dump I was living in, and find my dream life with a beautiful home... Â I never found it... I found Jesus Christ and ever since I realized I am richer than any person!! Â Thank You for Sharing your pictures and for taking me back to my childhood !!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Nathan, Enjoyed your talk last Sunday fromÂ &lt;strong&gt;Hennessey + Ingalls Art bookstore vis Zoom.&lt;/strong&gt;

Would like to snail mail you a book with photos from downtown Los Angeles.

It was from Los Angeles photographer Ray McSavaney who passed away in 2014. I have Ray&#039;s archives. Currently have a lightbox photo exhibit at Union Station on my Los Angeles underground transportation project.

Thanks,

Ken Karagozian

					<description><![CDATA[I have realized some new items from your web site about computers. Another thing I have always thought is that computer systems have become a product that each house must have for many people reasons. They offer convenient ways in which to organize households, pay bills, go shopping, study, tune in to music and in some cases watch tv series. An innovative way to complete every one of these tasks is with a computer. These personal computers are portable ones, small, robust and portable.]]></description>
