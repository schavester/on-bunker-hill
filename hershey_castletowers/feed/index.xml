the unfortunate truth of the mater is, a short while after they were moved a transiant started a fire in the fire place of one of the homes burning both to the ground.

Hello Decoy,
I am a volunteer and researcher for Heritage Square Musuem. I am also the Executive Curator of an upcoming exhibit entitled, &#034;The Long Road Home: History of Heritage Square&#034;. This exhibit will focus primarily on the buildings we currently have but will also contain information about the museum&#039;s beginnings with the Castle and Salt Box. The exhibit opens December 1st and will run through March, 2009. 2009 will also mark our 40th Anniversary and will host a large variety of events and exhibits about Los Angeles and also a &#039;walk&#039; to commemorate the move of the Castle and Salt Box from Bunker Hill to the Heritage Square.

					<description><![CDATA[Good blog post but I am a bit confused about this structure&#039;s current whereabouts. I&#039;m not sure if I missed something but What actually happened to this structure? Was it eventually demolished? 

The opening paragraph states: &quot;When the Castle and Salt Box were physically moved from Bunker Hill to Heritage Square in Highland Park, it was probably a sight most residents had never seen.&quot;

I looked up Heritage Square in Highland Park but did not see this structure listed there on their website.

The closing statement reads: &quot;As for the former residence-turned-apartment building, the Castle Towers and its residents lived a peaceful existence and until the mid-1950s when the Community Redevelopment Agency came a callin&#039;.&quot;

It&#039;s not really clear to me what &quot;when the Community Redevelopment Agency came a callin&#039;&quot; means exactly.

Thanks ]]></description>
