					<description><![CDATA[Hi Gordon, I&#039;m finding the history of Bunker Hill so intriguing. You mention the city&#039;s skyline, and that got me wondering, do you remember if the beautiful Eastern Columbia Building was visible from Bunker Hill when you were living there? Maybe from atop Angel&#039;s Flight or the lookout tower above that? Thanks!]]></description>
