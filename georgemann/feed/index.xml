					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;
Ok, Mr. gsj, since you threw down the gauntlet n&#039;all -- how could I refuse?Â  Alright everybody, pull up a pillow...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Bunker Hill, famous wonderland of genteel gingerbread and gabled gothic:Â  but among the twisted turrets and distressed trusswork lived the odd massive Mission and beatific Beaux Arts building.Â  Why, here&#039;s a representative sample:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1173/4726594368_518e725aea_b.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;thefuture!&quot; height=&quot;491&quot; width=&quot;548&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wait, &lt;i&gt;what&lt;/i&gt;?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Who would dare build a modern home amongst the homos and hopheads, the junkies and johns, the grifters and grime?Â  Well, let&#039;s think about this.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Having spent a year searching for crime amongst the spindlework and bougainvillea, I for one don&#039;t think BH was as bad as the City made it out to be.Â  There may have been more money thrown at the fire department and health care and five-oh than the City got back in good old-fashioned taxes, but if &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; became cause for wholesale demolition tomorrow, we&#039;d lose two-thirds of 2010 Los Angeles with one swipe.Â  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Moreover Oliver was forward-thinking in his abjuration of the &#039;burbs for moving -- hell, &lt;i&gt;building&lt;/i&gt; -- right downtown.Â  He prefigured the downtown boosters of the &#039;aughts by fifty years.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You see, Stuart K. Oliver was an attorney with a practice downtown, and who wants to fight traffic coming into work?Â  (I&#039;m not sold on the attorney angle, which we find in the photo archives; the newspapers describe him as a &#034;businessman&#034; and he was apparently Chairman of the LA Chapter of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.asmwest.com/&quot; title=&quot;asm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ASM&lt;/a&gt;.)Â  In any event, he and his wife were attracted to living downtown.Â  They chose a spot on Bunker Hill in the early fifties.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But, you ask,Â  wasn&#039;t the CRA newly formed?Â  Weren&#039;t the seeds of destruction being sown by Sesnon?Â  Would that not give him pause and fill him with trrrrrrrepidation? Cetainly, but in the early 50s you could still look over the 136 acres, the 400 some-odd structures, the 9000+ residents and say, &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt;?Â  They&#039;ll clear this in my lifetime?Â  This isn&#039;t Russia, y&#039;know.Â  (In 1950, Los Angeles, though populous, was one of America&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0027/tab18.txt&quot; title=&quot;ourtinyburg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;least-dense cities&lt;/a&gt;Â  -- however the City deemed Bunker Hill &lt;i&gt;too dense&lt;/i&gt;, hence its need for demolition.Â  [Of course it was less dense &lt;i&gt;then&lt;/i&gt; than any of LA&#039;s eighty-eight cities are &lt;i&gt;now&lt;/i&gt;, on top of which every city is, ironically, pushing for New Urbanist &#034;density bonuses&#034;...but I digress].)Â  Of course by &#039;59 the Feds had approved all the grants and loans and the City Council jumped on the thing and that was that, but that, for the time being, is the future.Â  Back to ca. 1952:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So if you had to live in the middle of America&#039;s fourth-largest city, would you choose to be crammed down in the flats?Â  If you wanted a view, would you have an airless apartment up some filing cabinet?Â  Or live up the side of some godforsaken hill covered in winding roads and devoid of parking?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Oliver was a genius.Â  He picked a perch perfect for light, air, sun, and, it being Bunker Hill, which had next to no auto ownership, plenty of peace on that front.Â  It was the rough equivalent of twenty stories up a skyscraper, with a 200-degree view across greater Los Angeles.Â  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A little bit about the site.Â Â  You have of course read about the &lt;a href=&quot;/hildreth_mansion&quot; title=&quot;Hildy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hildreth Mansion&lt;/a&gt; at Fourth and Hope.Â  You may not realize that one of the reasons it was such a stunning house is that besides its view toward downtown:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1123/4726594104_4b7416f9dc_b.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;hildrethtowardt&quot; height=&quot;376&quot; width=&quot;525&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Its backside sat atop a great promontory that presided over Flower, Figueroa and a view toward the Pacific on a clear day.Â  Here&#039;s the Hildreth in 1906 (bottom, at 357):
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1412/4726595990_432af918de_b.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;hildreth1906&quot; height=&quot;494&quot; width=&quot;525&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And again in 1951, nothing much has changed in that part of the world:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1381/4726594524_539df1fb9b_b.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;sanborn51&quot; height=&quot;502&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; /&gt;Now look what&#039;s happened to 353/351 in 1953:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1050/4725946265_62dd2ba2c2_b.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;sanborn1953&quot; height=&quot;488&quot; width=&quot;525&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Some crazy bastard has built the most modern house in Moderntown!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Note the way in which the Oliver house has been worked into the old Hildreth wall to the north--apparently, I read on another site, the site of the Hildreth carriage house:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1191/4725945483_709a7d379f_b.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;hildreth&quot; height=&quot;581&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1173/4726594368_518e725aea_b.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;oliver wall&quot; height=&quot;491&quot; width=&quot;548&quot; /&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
But Oliver&#039;s neighbor the Hildreth was not to stand long.Â  We&#039;ve talked a little bit about the Fourth Street Cut &lt;a href=&quot;/TheZelda&quot; title=&quot;4thAndZelda&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and it was into that ditch went everything holding up the Hildreth.Â  And the Hildreth.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A lot got lost along 4th in &#039;54.Â  Heck,&lt;i&gt; 4th&lt;/i&gt; was lost in &#039;54, dropped two stories below.Â  Better for Oliver.Â  Left up there with greater splendid isolation.Â  By &#039;57 there were even fewer cars on the Hill as homes and apartments (The Melrose, et al) were demo&#039;d for the Court House and Hall of Administration...by &#039;61 the wholesale leveling began and continued for some years...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
...and life wasn&#039;t always easy.Â  The sixties wore on and while the nights must have become much, much quieter, the days were full of smoke-belching bulldozers regrading streets, and neighboring structures falling to the sickening sound of splintering wood and collapsing brick.Â  Soon Hope Street was cut off to the South.Â  Now not only blocks from downtown, but cut off from any sign of civilization, the mailman routinely got lost en route to 353 S. Hope.Â  Eventually even the &lt;a href=&quot;/CRA_relocation_offices&quot; title=&quot;cra&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CRA offices&lt;/a&gt; at 238 S. Grand crumpled, the &lt;a href=&quot;/castle&quot; title=&quot;castle&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Castle&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;/salt_box&quot;&gt;Salt Box&lt;/a&gt; were hauled off, and precious little was left beside the &lt;a href=&quot;/HotelBelmont&quot; title=&quot;belmont&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Belmont&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/hoteltrenton&quot; title=&quot;trenty&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Trenton&lt;/a&gt; and half-demolished &lt;a href=&quot;/taxonomy_menu/6/133&quot; title=&quot;theNorthern&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Northern&lt;/a&gt;.Â  But that was June of &#039;69.Â  Let&#039;s jump back a bit.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Oliver had signed an owner-participant agreement with the CRA in 1959; the CRA&#039;s own laws stipulated he didn&#039;t have to sell to them, but could redevelop the property in accordance with the Project&#039;s master plan.Â Â Â  His lot was 7,940sf -- about 12% of the four-acre block, but he had the ability to acquire another 23,000sf (the apartment block next door), which would allow him to build a 150-unit apartment house.Â  That would be within the Redevelopment Agency&#039;s Master Plan, after all.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But there&#039;s where it gets sticky:Â  through the early 60s the CRA began to &#034;redevelop&#034; their redevelopment plan, and looked to renege on Oliver&#039;s agreement.Â  The potential development numbers the CRA had placed on the project in 1962 had ballooned from $300 million to, in 1969, more than $700 million.Â  In short, the CRA didn&#039;t want Oliver and his penny-ante stuff, or, as a friend of Oliver&#039;s said about Oliver&#039;s attempt to redevelop his hilltop parcel:Â  &#034;The hill just grew up around us.&#034;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Oliver came back with a concept for the entire block--a thirteen story, 400-unit hillside structure with a large garage at the base of the hill.Â  Then seventeen floors with 500 units.Â  The CRA and the Feds still couldn&#039;t live with it and the attorneys bickered some more.Â  The bigger Oliver offered--despite his having a 100% legally sound agreement--the less the CRA wanted to hear about it.Â  They were going to go &lt;i&gt;really big&lt;/i&gt;.Â  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So, back to the Summer of &#039;69.Â  Oliver, finally beaten, sells out.Â  The Caltech Petroleum Investment Corp., subsidiary of The Pasadena Institute (a front for Security Pacific National) buys Oliver&#039;s house for an estimated $500,000 ($2,893,144 USD 2009) -- not bad, considering his initial ca. 1952 investment of $90,000 pencils out to $719,451 USD 2009.Â  In 1967 the CRA had valued the entire block (96,000sf) at $1,000,000; therefore 500k for his under 8,000sf is not too shabby.Â  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There isn&#039;t much else to tell.Â  The most descriptive and telling element of the whole affair comes from the &lt;i&gt;Times&lt;/i&gt; article &#034;Crew Demolishes Last House on Bunker Hill&#034; dated September 24, 1969, where it&#039;s mentioned that the residence &#034;was pushed off the hilltop perch.&#034;Â 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now let&#039;s look at some photos:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
About the 4th St Cut AKA the Viaduct...now, here&#039;s a pre-1954 image:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1017/4726596062_6fe8e69612_b.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;4th&quot; height=&quot;371&quot; width=&quot;526&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Flower runs up the middle of this pic; note how 4th, horizontal above the big white building on the left, stops at Flower.Â  It had to.Â  There was a giant f&#039;ing hill there. Â  One had to &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; something about it.Â  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&#160;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1323/4726595530_9dd941b395_b.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Dec54&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; width=&quot;510&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Above, December 1954, they&#039;re digging out the 4th Street 
Viaduct.Â  The crane is sitting about twenty feet beneath where the 
Hildreth used to be.Â  The arrow points to the Oliver House in an attempt
to say &#034;Oh, isn&#039;t that precious?&#034; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The cut -- the Oliver house is the &#034;C&#034; shape in the upper right:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Note, below, Oliver&#039;s view is now somewhat obscured by the A. C. Martin Union Bank bldg.Â  Back and to the left, the 238 S. Grand CRA buildings, and just over his shoulder, the Castle and Salt Box.Â  1968. 
&lt;/p&gt;

Cetainly, but in the early 50s you could still look over the 136 acres, the 400 some-odd structures, the 9000+ residents and say, <i>really</i>?Â  They&#8217;ll clear this in my lifetime?Â  This isn&#8217;t Russia, y&#8217;know.Â  (In 1950, Los Angeles, though populous, was one of America&#8217;s <a href="http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0027/tab18.txt" title="ourtinyburg" target="_blank">least-dense cities</a>Â  &#8212; however the City deemed Bunker Hill <i>too dense</i>, hence its need for demolition.Â  [Of course it was less dense <i>then</i> than any of LA&#8217;s eighty-eight cities are <i>now</i>, on top of which every city is, ironically, pushing for New Urbanist &quot;density bonuses&quot;&#8230;but I digress].)Â  Of course by &#8217;59 the Feds had approved all the grants and loans and the City Council jumped on the thing and that was that, but that, for the time being, is the future.Â  Back to ca. 1952:</p>
<p>So if you had to live in the middle of America&#8217;s fourth-largest city, would you choose to be crammed down in the flats?Â  If you wanted a view, would you have an airless apartment up some filing cabinet?Â  Or live up the side of some godforsaken hill covered in winding roads and devoid of parking?</p>
<p>Oliver was a genius.Â  He picked a perch perfect for light, air, sun, and, it being Bunker Hill, which had next to no auto ownership, plenty of peace on that front.Â  It was the rough equivalent of twenty stories up a skyscraper, with a 200-degree view across greater Los Angeles.Â  </p>
<p>A little bit about the site.Â Â  You have of course read about the <a href="/hildreth_mansion" title="Hildy" target="_blank">Hildreth Mansion</a> at Fourth and Hope.Â  You may not realize that one of the reasons it was such a stunning house is that besides its view toward downtown:
</p>

<p>Its backside sat atop a great promontory that presided over Flower, Figueroa and a view toward the Pacific on a clear day.Â  Here&#8217;s the Hildreth in 1906 (bottom, at 357):

<p>And again in 1951, nothing much has changed in that part of the world:

<p>Some crazy bastard has built the most modern house in Moderntown!</p>
<p>Note the way in which the Oliver house has been worked into the old Hildreth wall to the north&#8211;apparently, I read on another site, the site of the Hildreth carriage house:
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1173/4726594368_518e725aea_b.jpg" alt="oliver wall" height="491" width="548" />
</p>
<p>
But Oliver&#8217;s neighbor the Hildreth was not to stand long.Â  We&#8217;ve talked a little bit about the Fourth Street Cut <a href="/TheZelda" title="4thAndZelda" target="_blank">here</a> and it was into that ditch went everything holding up the Hildreth.Â  And the Hildreth.</p>
<p>A lot got lost along 4th in &#8217;54.Â  Heck,<i> 4th</i> was lost in &#8217;54, dropped two stories below.Â  Better for Oliver.Â  Left up there with greater splendid isolation.Â  By &#8217;57 there were even fewer cars on the Hill as homes and apartments (The Melrose, et al) were demo&#8217;d for the Court House and Hall of Administration&#8230;by &#8217;61 the wholesale leveling began and continued for some years&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;and life wasn&#8217;t always easy.Â  The sixties wore on and while the nights must have become much, much quieter, the days were full of smoke-belching bulldozers regrading streets, and neighboring structures falling to the sickening sound of splintering wood and collapsing brick.Â  Soon Hope Street was cut off to the South.Â  Now not only blocks from downtown, but cut off from any sign of civilization, the mailman routinely got lost en route to 353 S. Hope.Â  Eventually even the <a href="/CRA_relocation_offices" title="cra" target="_blank">CRA offices</a> at 238 S. Grand crumpled, the <a href="/castle" title="castle" target="_blank">Castle</a> and the <a href="/salt_box">Salt Box</a> were hauled off, and precious little was left beside the <a href="/HotelBelmont" title="belmont" target="_blank">Belmont</a> and <a href="/hoteltrenton" title="trenty" target="_blank">Trenton</a> and half-demolished <a href="/taxonomy_menu/6/133" title="theNorthern" target="_blank">Northern</a>.Â  But that was June of &#8217;69.Â  Let&#8217;s jump back a bit.</p>
<p>Oliver had signed an owner-participant agreement with the CRA in 1959; the CRA&#8217;s own laws stipulated he didn&#8217;t have to sell to them, but could redevelop the property in accordance with the Project&#8217;s master plan.Â Â Â  His lot was 7,940sf &#8212; about 12% of the four-acre block, but he had the ability to acquire another 23,000sf (the apartment block next door), which would allow him to build a 150-unit apartment house.Â  That would be within the Redevelopment Agency&#8217;s Master Plan, after all.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s where it gets sticky:Â  through the early 60s the CRA began to &quot;redevelop&quot; their redevelopment plan, and looked to renege on Oliver&#8217;s agreement.Â  The potential development numbers the CRA had placed on the project in 1962 had ballooned from $300 million to, in 1969, more than $700 million.Â  In short, the CRA didn&#8217;t want Oliver and his penny-ante stuff, or, as a friend of Oliver&#8217;s said about Oliver&#8217;s attempt to redevelop his hilltop parcel:Â  &quot;The hill just grew up around us.&quot;</p>
<p>Oliver came back with a concept for the entire block&#8211;a thirteen story, 400-unit hillside structure with a large garage at the base of the hill.Â  Then seventeen floors with 500 units.Â  The CRA and the Feds still couldn&#8217;t live with it and the attorneys bickered some more.Â  The bigger Oliver offered&#8211;despite his having a 100% legally sound agreement&#8211;the less the CRA wanted to hear about it.Â  They were going to go <i>really big</i>.Â  </p>
<p>So, back to the Summer of &#8217;69.Â  Oliver, finally beaten, sells out.Â  The Caltech Petroleum Investment Corp., subsidiary of The Pasadena Institute (a front for Security Pacific National) buys Oliver&#8217;s house for an estimated $500,000 ($2,893,144 USD 2009) &#8212; not bad, considering his initial ca. 1952 investment of $90,000 pencils out to $719,451 USD 2009.Â  In 1967 the CRA had valued the entire block (96,000sf) at $1,000,000; therefore 500k for his under 8,000sf is not too shabby.Â  </p>
<p>There isn&#8217;t much else to tell.Â  The most descriptive and telling element of the whole affair comes from the <i>Times</i> article &quot;Crew Demolishes Last House on Bunker Hill&quot; dated September 24, 1969, where it&#8217;s mentioned that the residence &quot;was pushed off the hilltop perch.&quot;Â 
</p>
<p>
Now let&#8217;s look at some photos:
</p>
<p>
About the 4th St Cut AKA the Viaduct&#8230;now, here&#8217;s a pre-1954 image:
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Flower runs up the middle of this pic; note how 4th, horizontal above the big white building on the left, stops at Flower.Â  It had to.Â  There was a giant f&#8217;ing hill there. Â  One had to <i>do</i> something about it.Â 
</p>

</p>
<p>
Above, December 1954, they&#8217;re digging out the 4th Street<br />
Viaduct.Â  The crane is sitting about twenty feet beneath where the<br />
Hildreth used to be.Â  The arrow points to the Oliver House in an attempt<br />
to say &quot;Oh, isn&#8217;t that precious?&quot;
</p>
<p>
The cut &#8212; the Oliver house is the &quot;C&quot; shape in the upper right:

<p>
Note, below, Oliver&#8217;s view is now somewhat obscured by the A. C. Martin Union Bank bldg.Â  Back and to the left, the 238 S. Grand CRA buildings, and just over his shoulder, the Castle and Salt Box.Â  1968.

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;
So, of the image six photos down, I wrote &lt;i&gt;...On the right of the Richelieu is this weird 30s building that doesn&#039;t get photographed often and more work has to be done on it.&lt;/i&gt; Â  Rick Mechtly, Bunker Historian &lt;span class=&quot;mention-Latn&quot;&gt;extraordinaire, &lt;/span&gt;wrote to tell me that the house there was built in 1898 by J. P. Miller as a home (likely the same JPM of 201 S Bunker Hill fame) and went through a couple of owners before being renamed The Stowell on becoming an apartment house.Â  He and I both conjectured that it had had a major facelift/renovation on its thrust into modernity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1272/4704438872_58086523f3_o.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;144IsStreamlinyGood&quot; height=&quot;405&quot; width=&quot;335&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
But conjecture is just that.Â  One has to &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt;, and until all available resources are exhausted...we know you would demand no less.Â  So the City Archives were attacked with righteous fury, and guess what turned up?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
But first a little backstory.Â  For the better part of a decade the Works Progress Administration, AKA the Work Projects Administration, was the largest employer in the nation.Â  They employed people to do basically any big ol&#039; crazy thing and brother, in 1940, building a &lt;a href=&quot;/FieldTrip&quot; title=&quot;ft&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;giant model&lt;/a&gt; of Los Angeles was one big ol&#039; crazy thing.Â  And glad we are for it.Â  Originally twenty-four panels, four panels today remain, and are on exhibit down at the Natural History Museum (actually, it&#039;s undergoing restoration and is off exhibit til 2012). Â 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Before each little model building could be built and painted and placed, the whole thing, block by block, had to be sketched.Â  These thousands of sketches are still with us in the LA City Archives. Â  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here&#039;s a drawing of the corner (on the drawing it&#039;s noted that a model of the block, and thus this building, was made in November 1939).Â  There&#039;s the Richelieu in the center, and at the corner the 1898 144 S. Grand:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
But aha!Â  Something happened during the sketching process that mucked up their plans.Â  Note the cross-out marks through the house.Â  Here, then, is a piece of addenda tucked within the stacks:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&#034;New Structure&#034; with a totally different footprint. Â  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This building was modeled March, 1940 and placed on the model May 1. 
&lt;/p&gt;

Where it sits to this day:

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Fascinating that a Moderne building would be built, of all places, on Bunker Hill.Â  Of course it only made it to age seventeen.Â Â

Kudos to Rick Mechtly for the keen observation. I am looking at my copy of Politi&#039;s &lt;i&gt;Bunker Hill, Los Angeles&lt;/i&gt; (which smells of cigarettes, ugh) and the photo matches up perfectly to Politi&#039;s painting, down to faded green paint, the turn of the porch supports and the distinctive ladder-like screen behind the orange cat. We even catch Politi in some small creative license: the screen should be on both sides of the porch, but he&#039;s left out the left side in order to better show the second rocking chair, and omited the diagonal wooden slats entirely.

&lt;p&gt;
Mr. Rick Mechtly, Bunker Hill expert, has let me know that the images of the lady and her cat were 246 S Bunker Hill Ave.Â  246 and 244 were to the south of the Brousseau at 238 and were built by the judge as well.Â  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Rick also pointed out that this house is featured in Leo Politi&#039;s 1964 collection of paintings &lt;i&gt;Bunker Hill, Los Angeles:Â  Reminiscences of Bygone Days&lt;/i&gt;.Â  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So I pulled that off the shelf and not only is the house in there, but the illustration and the text -- the reminiscence -- is all about Rose, the old lady who lived there for many a year and took care of animals in distress.Â  And that when the time came to be relocated, her faithful dog, her cats, and even the birds followed her. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thank you Rick! 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Gordon!Â  Thank you so much for pointing that out.Â  That was very silly of me -- one can see the orange-ish beige 333 next to the Castle a couple photos down -- and I knew there was a house between the Castle and the Salt Box, having learned so from Christina&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;/333_BunkerHill&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;wonderful post&lt;/a&gt; about it.Â  But in my zeal I jumped over it, which is a shame, since 333 was such a beautifulÂ  house, as you say.Â  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thanks again, Nathan
&lt;/p&gt;
