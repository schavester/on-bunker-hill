					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine sent me pictures of Old Los Angeles over 10 years ago, because he knew that I was born in Los Angeles. Â One picture stoped me in my tracks, and It was &#8220;The Castle&#8221;! Â I could swear I had seen it some where before and I can&#8217;t put my finger on it. Â  I have been obsessed with trying to find out who the original architect wasÂ for the floor plan lay-out was before the add-ons. Â Would you have any idea of who it is? Or who they are?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Old Los Angeles has been my muse for all my art projects while I attended the local college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;
