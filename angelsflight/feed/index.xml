&lt;b&gt;THE QUIET &lt;/b&gt;old folks who live near the upper level of Angels Flight at 3rd and
Olive are not easy to surprise but they got a good one yesterday.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A bunch of maniacs showed up at noon and stood on the launching platform
and sipped champagne, munched barbecued ribs and rode up and down on
one of the two cars, commandeered for the lunch hour.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Not only that, photographers kept shooting pictures of some joker named Jim
Hawthorne as he stood on the west end of the ascending and descending
car like a touring politician. For the occasion a sign had been placed
on it, &#034;Save Angels Flight.&#034; What had the natives nudging each other
was the tuxedo Hawthorne was wearing. This is strictly sport-shirt
territory.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It seems, Hawthorne, who has a show on KTTV, had some
time to spare yesterday and decided to save Angels Flight whether it
needed saving or not. No one is certain. The owners, L. B. Moreland and
his wife, who were present, attended the recent hearings on the
proposed redevelopment project and there was no mention of the
one-block railway&#039;s future. Neither was it included in the bright new
plans for the hill after it is leveled and the architects start fresh.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Odd thing about yesterday&#039;s proceedings was that hardly any of the
gentlemen busily saving Angels Flight had ever ridden on it before.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt; DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;postbody&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
-- On Saturday, Nov. 1, the two cars that long ran on Angels Flight
were returned to the track that connects Bunker Hill and the Historic
Core. The cars, named Olivet and Sinai, were brought to Hill Street
Saturday morning and were lifted by a 275-ton crane over the arch at
the bottom of the funicular and placed on the track.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It is a significant step forward for the railway, which has been
closed since a deadly accident in 2001. Last year, new drive machinery
was installed, and late last week, a cable for the drive was being
tested. No date has been set yet for when the railway could resume
operations.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
â€œWhile there still are many weeks of fine-tuning and testing yet
to be undertaken, we are hopeful that Angels Flight will reopen to the
public late this year or early in 2009,â€ said Dennis Luna, chairman of
the Angels Flight Railway Foundation.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
John Welborne, president of the Foundation, has spent significant
time in recent years raising money for a renovation of the railway and
the new drive system.
