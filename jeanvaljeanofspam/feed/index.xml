					<description><![CDATA[It wasnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t that gay folk bunked on Bunker exclusively at 221â€”but 221 was an important touchstone in the gay movement.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
221 South Bunker Hill was the home of Tony Reyes, aka Antonio Sanchez, life-partner of â€œDauntlessâ€ &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.outhistory.org/wiki/Don_Slater&quot; title=&quot;DDS&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Don Slater&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
One spring night in 1945, when Slater was twenty-one years old, he went cruising in nearby Pershing Square, where he met a slender Hispanic boy of about sixteen named Antonio Sanchez.  As Slater described the meeting to Hansen, the two repeatedly bumped into each other while prowling through the bushes. â€œWhat! You again?â€ they laughed. They joked that they must have been meant for each other, and indeed, they were to remain partners until Slaterâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s death nearly fifty-two years later. After living together for a while in a ski lodge belonging to Slaterâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s parents, Slater and Sanchez moved into an apartment at 221 South Bunker Hill Avenue, in one of the Victorian mansions Slater admired. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In fact, Joseph Hansenâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s biography of Slater, &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://gaytoday.com/garchive/reviews/040698re.htm&quot; title=&quot;afdwoh&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;A Few Doors West of Hope&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, is so named because 221 was just that (truth be told, 221 was a stoneâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s throw &lt;i&gt;east&lt;/i&gt; of Hope St., but we must suppose &lt;i&gt;west&lt;/i&gt; comes off more mellifluously).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Note Sanchezâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s 221 address on the 1953 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.outhistory.org/wiki/ONE%2C_Incorporated%E2%80%99s_Articles_of_Incorporation&quot; title=&quot;AOI&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Articles of Incorporation&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ONE,_Inc.&quot; title=&quot;nottheloneliestnumberapparently&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;One&lt;/a&gt;, and outgrowth  of â€œhomophile collectiveâ€ &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mattachine_Society&quot; title=&quot;MatSoc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mattachine Society&lt;/a&gt;  (founder Harry Hay details another Pershing Square encounter &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.outhistory.org/wiki/Harry_Hay:_Founding_the_Mattachine_Society%2C_1948-1953#Early_Life&quot; title=&quot;goodoldpershingsquare&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Girvigian&#039;s report runs like so:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;221 South Bunker Hill Avenue (originally 123)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Two-story frame residence, built in 1895, attributed to Frederick Sparr or Judge Halton.  (From interviews of residents on Hill.)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A two-story frame residence with finished attic; was finally rooming house containing 20 rooms; total of 4,342 square feet, plus 99 square foot open wood front porch; 349 square foot covered rear porch and 260 square foot brick rear covered porch.  Foundation was brick.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Interior of typical pine board flooring, wood doors, windows, trim and stairway; walls and ceilings of lath and plaster.  Overall dimensions:  42â€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> x 78â€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />, apporximately.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;September 1963.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3113/3153662051_4cb4788f31_o.gif&quot; alt=&quot;221JumpSt&quot; height=&quot;407&quot; width=&quot;575&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&#160;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A little digging for â€œFrederick Sparrâ€ yielded only that there was a man so named in London, who, as a believer in â€œgay funerals,â€ shocked mourners in 1907 by officiating at the funeral of a church deacon dressed in a &lt;i&gt;gray suit of clothes&lt;/i&gt;.  â€œI am heartily sick of the paganism connected to Christian funerals,â€ said Sparr, â€œâ€¦so I wore a gray suit and we sang the Easter hymn.â€
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As to Halton, there was a Deputy District Attorney Halton here in the 90s.  Whether or not he became a Judge, much less built this house, remains a mystery.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
