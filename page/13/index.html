		<p>Bunker Hill has had many landmarks, but perhaps none so little remembered as the massive foundations lain at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=431+S+Grand+Ave,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90071&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=68.98527,101.953125&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=34.051948,-118.253381&amp;spn=0.009031,0.012445&amp;t=h&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr" title="431sgrand" target="_blank" rel="noopener">431 South Grand</a> many years ago.  They were great concrete things, poured about the time of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_of_1893" title="GrandOldPanic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Great Panic</a>, or the <a href="http://thehistorybox.com/ny_city/panics/panics_article12a.htm" title="panictheyounger" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lesser Panic</a>, and served as Hill touchstone and reminder of ambitious building projects halted by devious economies.  But L. H. Mills and J. G. Talbott have come along and said <i>fooey</i>!  We reject these in their totality and all they represent, and with that utterly destroyed the foundations and have, in the style of all that is great and noble of the year 1912, set out to build from the ground up the finest apartment hotel available.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3045/2619773022_0f8cf7c8e7_o.gif" alt="theSherwood" height="583" width="575"></p>
<p>
The building is 75&#215;176”&#x2122; and contains 160 rooms.  Despite its vaguely<br>
French Renaissance air, it is named the Nottinghamshire-evoking<br>
<i>Sherwood</i>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3207/2618137049_bc2f89840c_o.gif" alt="Sherwhynot" height="220" width="350"></p>
<p>The lobby is 50&#215;41”&#x2122;, finished in mahogany, its inglenook containing a large fireplace.  Each Sherwood apartment contains a private dressing room with built-in dresser and mirror.  Whereas law stipulates the minimum space for apartment living rooms as 120 square feet, the Sherwood&#8217;s are 190; where the legal minimum for hallways is three feet six inches, Mills and Talbott see that theirs will be six feet across.  Just because.  <br>

<p>In June of 1915, the Sherwood hosted the wedding of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0366742/" title="thegreatPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">P. C. Hartigan</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0366473/" title="bestillmybeatinghart" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Peggy Hart</a>, in the apartments of their pal, Sherwoodian Mrs. Dick Ferris, and in the company of Judge Summerfield and many a jolly Hollywood pal.<br>

Soon after, however, the quality of Hollywood Type there began to decline.  Even in our TMZ era that abjures accomplishment and rewards reprobation, dag, that <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0941745/" title="HLW" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Helen Lee Worthing</a> gave society a run for its money.  And surely set Sherwood tongues a-wagging.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3118/2620005308_42339312b2_o.gif" alt="HLW" align="right" height="325" width="250">Worthing was a statuesque Bostonian-by-way-of-Kentucky who”&#x2122;d become a Ziegfeld Follies girl–the toast of New York, and lady-friend of a New York mayor, it was said.  Darling of the rotogravure section, it was then on to Hollywood, where she made pictures galore while at the same time gracing nightly Ziegfeld”&#x2122;s well-known assemblage of pulchritude.</p>
<p>She”&#x2122;d always had a tempestuous time of it”¦in 1922, after a Hearst paper described in detail Worthing&#8217;s New York catfight with another chorus girl–including a cartoon depicting the biting and clawing–she elected to end her life by swallowing bichloride of mercury.  Ended up in Bellevue.</p>
<p>Once in Hollywood she made the papers in more light-hearted ways; in 1925 she drove her car off a cliff and from there atop the roof of a house in Whitley Heights.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3025/2620005226_37bfba4d52_o.gif" alt="hlw2" align="left" height="350" width="245"><br>
But her career continued to blossom; Mary Pickford called her the most beautiful woman in the world, and  <a href="http://www.illustration-house.com/bios/fisher_bio.html" title="HF" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Harrison Fisher</a> adjudged her the most beautiful profile in America.  In 1926–the year she starred with Barrymore in <i>Don Juan</i>–she demanded $100,000 from a perfume company that had used her image.</p>
<p>But 1927 was to change all that.  In April she was the victim of a violent beating, administered by an intruder, which left her with a broken nose, knocked-out tooth and discolored eyes.  And five days of delirium.  Her colored maid called Dr. Eugene Nelson, noted Negro physician, to see after her famous employer.  </p>
<p>And it was love!  They threw society”&#x2122;s strictures aside (it was still forty years before <i>Loving v. Virginia</i> and eighty til <i>Seal n</i>”&#x2122;<i> Heidi</i>) and set about on a whirlwind romance that resulted in a secret Tijuana wedding in June.  The fact that there was no intruder, and Nelson had to care for someone in a mad fit of drunkenness (or, more precisely, a drunken fit of madness) should have given him pause.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3241/2620005398_7fc74ebaff_o.jpg" alt="helooksasblackasIdo" align="left" height="241" width="135">They keep the wedding secret but is revealed to the world late in 1929, after their estrangement becomes known.  His philandering, cruelty, jealously, and threats of confining her to some sort of institution are apparently too much for her.  </p>
<p>In 1930 she returns from a New York “Neurological Institute”&#157; where she”&#x2122;s been treated for&#8230;the blues.  She is outted by a reporter as being shacked up at the Mayfair, and she moves into an unnamed apartment-house; likely The Sherwood, as she turns up there in short order.</p>
<p>Divorce proceedings stretch through the early 30s: she complains that he beats her and drugs her and forces her outside wearing only her negligee; he replies that they didn”&#x2122;t fulfill Mexican residential requirements and, as they”&#x2122;re not therefore legally wed, doesn”&#x2122;t owe her monthly monies.  By November 1932 she”&#x2122;s hallucinating that objects are being thrown at her, and is threatening suicide, and lands in the psychopathic ward of General Hospital.  The marriage is annulled in January 1933.</p>
<p>In June of 1933 she disappears from an eastbound Santa Fe train–it is assumed she jumped, or fell.  A three day search ensues.  Turns out she just got off at Pasadena, abandoning her bags and tickets.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3024/2621722712_742b1486dc_o.gif" alt="sherwoodarrest" align="right" height="140" width="252">On August 16, 1933, the coppers come to The Sherwood to collect Helen Lee Worthing on violation of her parole to the psychopathic department.  In a statement from her psych ward bed at General Hospital, Helen declared that she had been living quietly in her apartment, attempting to increase her income by writing poetry and short stories.  “I can”&#x2122;t understand who would complain and have me returned here,”&#157; she said.  “I have only been trying to get a start on my own ability.  Incidentally, I have fallen in love with a man who has been typing my poetry, but that has nothing to do with this.”&#157;</p>
<p>If only the story could end with her returning to the Sherwood, marrying the typist, and living long enough to move into the Bunker Hill Towers.  But it was not to be.  </p>
<p>In 1935 she is arrested on a drunk charge in Venice, and can”&#x2122;t come up with the $5 bail, or even the pals to post the bail for her; she spend ten days in Lincoln Heights jail.<br>
<img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3161/2621933808_6a4087d36c_o.gif" alt="error" height="400" width="143"><br>
In September 1935 she”&#x2122;s living in the <a href="http://www.childrensinstitute.org/about/history.php" title="BSL" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Big Sister League</a> Guest Home, when she again takes poison, this time over unrequited love.<br>
<img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3074/2620900207_4463acdc87_o.gif" alt="nursestrangle" height="500" width="283"><br>
In 1939 she”&#x2122;s sentenced to five months in County on a narcotics charge–passing forged morphine scrips and carrying a hypo in her purse.  In 1940 she”&#x2122;s given a year for the same MO.  (Interestingly, while in stir, going about her duties as a trusty in the woman”&#x2122;s ward of County, only three flights below was her ex-husband Dr. Eugene Nelson, awaiting his murder trial–not only was he practicing without a license, having lost that–but he killed a girl while aborting her fetus.)</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3022/2621723088_d35189fb00_o.gif" alt="checkup" height="339" width="500"><br>
In October 1942 she”&#x2122;s popped for public drunkenness outside a downtown roominghouse; she fails to appear in court for her hearing, but sends a note:  “I am leaving the State.  I do not feel I can get fair treatment in California courts.”&#157;  Needless to say, she does not leave the state.  Radio car officers were called to the scene of her beating by some “boyfriend”&#157; in her Centennial Street apartment in April 1944, and took her to Georgia Street Receiving where she was treated for half-inch laceration on the chin and a 1+1/2 inch cut on the back of her head; she does not press charges.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3280/2621015543_5c0ca25b9d_o.jpg" alt="uhoh" align="right" height="58" width="217">In 1946 she”&#x2122;s found downed and dazed at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=W+Sunset+Blvd+%26+Portia+St,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90026&amp;sll=34.076585,-118.254368&amp;sspn=0.008549,0.012445&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=34.076585,-118.254368&amp;spn=0.008549,0.012445&amp;t=h&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr" title="thebeginningoftheend" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Portia and Sunset</a>, and examination fails to find injury or illness.  She talks vaguely of trying to obtain rest by “self-hypnosis.”&#157;  Uh-huh.</p>
<p>Some would see this as a red flag; others as the checkered flag&#8230;the race is over.  In any event, people will sit in the stands waiting for a spectacular crash.  Most of the time, the car sputters and dies.  It”&#x2122;s just a matter of time, now.</p>
<p>August 25, 1948.  She dies of barbiturate poisoning, in a tiny house (1062 North Serrano, since wiped out by the Hollywood Freeway) surrounded by expensive scrapbooks bulging with clippings from her golden age.  Inside were penciled notes:  “I can”&#x2122;t stand another straw–it would be too much.”&#157;  Say hello next time you”&#x2122;re in <a href="http://www.inglewoodparkcemetery.org/" title="youdownwithIPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Inglewood</a>.</p>

<p>The Sherwood is now occupied roughly by the back side of the Welton Becket&#8217;s 1981 Mellon First Business Bank, and some miniaturized version of a street called “Hope Place.”&#157;  <br>

For anyone who may gripe that the majority of this page deals more with Hollywood than it does with Bunker Hill, believe me, brother, this isn”&#x2122;t the last you”&#x2122;ve heard of The Sherwood.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Here was the Van Fleet, a three-story frame apartment house built in 1911 by Garrett &amp; Bixby for citrus man Nelson Van Fleet. The 29 apartments were split between two- and three-room models, and it was in one of them on March 22, 1912, that Marie Higginson, 40-ish &quot;and quite prepossessing,&quot; having failed to shoot herself in San Pedro last week, gassed herself in the kitchen. Her groans alerted Mrs. Francis Passmore across the hall. Found unconscious on a blanket on the kitchen floor with the oven door removed,  Marie&#8217;s purse revealed the gun and a copy of Walter Malone&#8217;s poem <a href="http://www.poetry-archive.com/m/opportunity.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&quot;Opportunity&quot;</a>–a popular verse among self annihilators, for Joseph N. Vincent recently blew his brains out on Silverwood Hill with the last stanzas in his pocket.</p>
<p>Marie, though, did not die, and on awakening, confessed that in San Pedro her hand had shaken so that she had missed her mark. &quot;I didn&#8217;t shoot a second time because I feared I might not hit a vital spot and would die a lingering death.&quot; The cause of it all was her unhappiness with the mining man who was her companion, so she was trying to remove herself from the equation while he was away in Maricopa. Her miner returned to news that Marie was going before the lunacy commission, but we do not know how she fared there.</p>
<p>An L.A. Times article surveying the freakishly high cost of rents (up as much as 400% in four years) and the difficulty in finding a place that would accept children noted that a two-room apartment with a bath and kitchenette at the Van Fleet would set you back $75 a month in October 1920.</p>
<p>On New Years Eve 1932, 28-year-old entertainer Matthew Tormino left his apartment at the Van Fleet for a booking at the Verdugo Trout Club Lodge in Verdugo Hills. At some point while Tormino, James W. Curtis and Inez Stewart were amusing the guests, a large man became incensed and the talent made a dash for the door. Tormino was the last one out, and took a bullet to the hip. When questioned by police, all anyone could say was that the shooter was &quot;a big guy.&quot; Tormino was expected to recover, but we suggest he work on his act.</p>

		<p>Meet Ruth Winters, 31, of 350 S. Figueroa (<a href="/node/138" title="bowman" target="_blank" rel="noopener">site of the Bowman brothers&#8217; asphyxiation by cyanide gas poisoning</a>), an angular blonde with a naughty smile and a way with the fellas.  Despite her considerable charms, Ruth is on of the most detested women on Bunker Hill, or at least she is if you judge her by the names bestowed upon her by the <i>Times</i> and the thick stack of hysterical city ordinances set forth to curb her profession.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3165/2606100535_d706c671a1.jpg" alt="ruth" height="325" width="500"></p>
<p>Yes, Ruth is one of those &quot;harpies of Main Street,&quot; a B-girl at Marco&#8217;s Cafe at 513 S. Main, and Ruth is one of the best in the business (she&#8217;s the one with the world-weary eyes sitting in the front row, above).</p>
<p>When Marco&#8217;s makes a new hire, bartender Patsy Figlio always tells the girls to follow the &quot;experienced bust-out girl&quot; Ruth&#8217;s lead.  Pick your mark, clean out his wallet, and get rid of him fast.  And if he leaves with so much as a dime in his pocket, you&#8217;d better believe you&#8217;ll catch hell from Patsy.</p>
<p>Marco&#8217;s owner Louis Lobel told the girls to lay low when the heat was on, and Patsy made sure they worked the crowd hard when it wasn&#8217;t, and the whole thing works out just grand provided that the poor sap with the empty wallet is too embarrassed to let on to anyone that he got fleeced.  </p>
<p>But then Marine Sergeant William R. Okerman decided to visit Marco&#8217;s with $10 in cash, and 6 $20 traveler&#8217;s checks in his pocket.  Ruth moved in, embracing Okerman as he entered the bar and asking him how long since he&#8217;d had a woman.  What happened next was all a blur.  Ruth teased, Patsy poured champagne cocktails, and in a scant 30 minutes, the pair had taken Okerman for all he had.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3217/2606100403_e0074bfd4b.jpg" alt="convictions" height="152" width="378"><br>
The shameless Sgt. Okerman made a complaint to the police, right around the same time that Kathleen Krischenowski, a former Marco&#8217;s waitress, went in to apply for a job.  She was horrified by what she saw, and connected with the LAPD vice detail.  She and two other waitresses turned undercover informant, and told the police what was going on at Marco&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Their reports led to the arrests of Figlio, Lobel, Winters, and another b-girl, Beverly Reed.  They were charged with violation of 8 municipal laws, including indecent exposure, being lewd and dissolute, and conspiracy to violate the city&#8217;s b-girl ordinance, including 44 overt acts too filthy to print.</p>
<p>It was the first time that the District Attorney&#8217;s office had sought felony charges in a case involving violation of the b-girl ordinance, which had been in effect since 1939 (and drastically expanded after b-girls moved their trade to soda shops).</p>
<p>In the end, all four entered guilty pleas, though Winters and Reed were allowed to plead to misdemeanor charges.  Lobel and Figlio were sentenced to 3 years in Chino, while the women faced 6 months in the city jail.</p>

The two collared ringleaders were on their way to the station house when one of the youngsters tucked a lock of long hair under his cap”¦he being Miss Juanita Stuart, fourteen, of the Rossmere.  She protested tearfully when her mother was instructed by officers to burn the costume of khaki trousers, flannel shirt and boy”&#x2122;s sweater, and to keep the young lady attired in feminine apparel only thereafter.</p>
<p><b>July 1, 1927.</b>  William Barrett, Rossmerian, had been arrested at the hotel by officers on Volstead violations and entered into evidence was one large bottle of gin.

<p>Barrett went back to the Rossmere a free man, thankful to the police for working a miracle.</p>

But Bitters was descended upon by members of the Community Chest and the Salvation Army”&#x2122;s Golden Agers Club, who bundled him up and trundled him off to General Hosptial for psychiatric examination.  </p>

When the cops finally arrived at First and Hope they found Morales inside, having slashed his throat with a razor blade.  He was taken to the prison ward at General Hospital.</p>

Above photo borrowed from the <a href="http://www.csulb.edu/~odinthor/socal8.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&quot;A Visit to Old Los Angeles&quot;</a> website</p>
<p>January 13, 1913 was opening day for the Northern Hotel, a fireproof, 10-story establishment of 200 rooms with baths, built by F.W. Braun (wealthy president of the Braun corporation, dealers in assay and chemical lab equipment) and designed by his favorite architect W.J. Saunders. </p>
<p>It stood on the site of the old 3-story Carling Hotel, which the thrifty Mr. Braun ordered moved to the rear of a lot on the west side of Flower Street, just south of Court Street; Saunders was also reported working on a 3-story addition to the front of the old building to give it a modern face onto Flower.</p>
<p>
<img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3257/2566961122_def018ed10_o.png"></p>
<p>During the early days of the year long construction (estimated cost $100,000), the Northern was reported to have been leased for a period of ten years for a rental of $200,000. This prompted one L.A. Times reporter to muse &quot;the project is of especial interest as showing the sterling value of downtown frontage north of Fourth Street, revealing as it does the confidence of a leading capitalist in this older section of the city.&quot; </p>
<p>But things change quickly, even on old Bunker Hill, and by opening day leasee James Kincheloe was nowhere to be seen, with management undertaken by Frank L. and Blanche L. Crampton. The Cramptons were 20 year hoteliers, formerly of Seattle and Alaska. They most recently managed the Seminole Hotel on Flower Street. Sadly, their time at the Northern rang the final bell for their concord, for on Hallowe&#8217;en Eve 1916, Blanche peered through a transom and spotted Frank in the arms of another&#8230; a lady dentist! (Maybe she was just checking his bridge.) Blanche sued for divorce, noting that she had for some time been engaging detectives to follow Frank, but that she&#8217;d finally solved the case herself. After obtaining suitable visual evidence for the divorce, spry Blanche broke out the glass in the transom and climbed down into the dentist&#8217;s room, ordered her to put on her street clothes and marched the homewrecker right out of the hotel.</p>
<p>
Conveniently located at the intersection of Second and Clay, the Northern was a reinforced concrete structure curiously designed with Bunker Hill&#8217;s eventual demise in mind. Its foundations, you see, ran thirty feet down, to permit the addition of two extra floors of rooms should the hill ever be shaved away. Other innovations included running ice water in every room, a central vacuum system, steam heat, hydraulic elevators for passengers and freight, telephones, and a French parlor for the ladies on the fifth floor. </p>
<p>Entrance to the hotel was made though the Second Street lobby, a fantasia in Italian marble, bronze, mahogany and tilework. The Mission furnishings were of red leather. From Clay Street, one could reach the dining room and grill, also fitted out in the Mission style, as well as the laundry and work rooms. </p>
<p>The Northern was not a year old when it found its first unquiet spirit. Anna, wife of Butte, Montana capitalist Jacob Osenbrook, came to Los Angeles with her husband and son Arthur to spend Christmas in the city. She had been suffering depression for several months, and it was hoped a change of scene and altitude would ease her worries. The family had just checked into their suite, and Jacob and Anna were standing at the sixth floor window, amusing themselves by comparing the number of passing motorcars to horses. Anna was a horse fan, and exclaimed loudly whenever one entered the scene. In the midst of the conversation, Jacob went to the next room to get a glass of water. When he returned, the curtains were outside the window&#8230; and when he looked outside, he saw that Anna had joined the horses below.</p>
<p>By May 1919, the Northern was under new ownership, having passed from the Union Realty Company to the Los Angeles and Santa Monica Beach Company. A news report curiously describes the building as a 9-story structure, but they may not have been counting the service basements.</p>

<p>In July 1920 a bizarre incident unfolded at the Northern, when two little girls from Little Rock &#8212; Laura Cash and Margaret Martin ”“ arrived in Los Angeles and encountered a strange, ticked off lady who tossed a note addressed to Miss Martin into the room she shared with Miss Cash. It read: &quot;Margaret Martin, it will not pay you to keep on with Levee. A word to the wise is sufficient. Mrs. Levee.&quot;</p>
<p><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3128/2594688575_50012f94ef.jpg"><br>

<p>Baffled by this message, Miss Martin went off to take a stroll. It was then that Matilda, long estranged wife of attorney Frederick R. Levee, entered the Hotel Northern and returned to the room where she&#8217;d left the note, encountering there Miss Cash. Assuming Cash was Martin, as she had previously assumed Martin was messing with her hubby (later it was asserted that Martin&#8217;s visiting card was on Levee&#8217;s desk because his law partner knew her), Mrs. Levee brandished a cowhide whip and slashed Miss Clark five or six times across the face. Cash shrieked, of course, and her assailant fled. Where&#8217;s <a href="/bellanapoli">Eugene Corey</a> when you need him?</p>
<p><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3123/2595524162_0fdc105736.jpg"><br>
Above, Matilda Levee in action</p>
<p>Mrs. Levee, formerly of 1001 South Union Avenue, was at the time suing her husband for divorce and maintenance, and had previously whipped at least two other women who she believed to be involved with Frederick, who had long since abandoned her. Previous victims include Mrs. Emma K. Doyle of Chicago, whipped at the Hotel Clark in December 1918, and Mrs. Inez M. Farnham, a cabaret singer from the Philippines, whipped in a hotel dining room and chased down Broadway while Frederick watched. Police quickly located Matilda in Santa Monica and held her pending civil charges which went unfiled, as the Arkansans had suffered sufficient embarrassment. (Inez never sued either.) Matilda was, however, brought up before the Lunacy Commission at the behest of Frederick, found to be &quot;not absolutely normal, but not insane&quot; (this is the new slogan of On Bunker Hill), and freed.</p>
<p>Frederick Levee meanwhile checked the wind and fled the state, abandoning his car in El Paso and continuing east by rail. He was arrested in New Orleans by agents of the Nick Harris detective agency in March 1921 and was to be returned to Los Angeles to face judge Walton J. Wood, who had just ruled in Matilda&#8217;s favor on their divorce and the $200 monthly alimony she sought, and who was not amused that Frederick had missed the court date. At this hearing, Matilda testified that they had failed to live happily as husband and wife, and that she had finally told him to &quot;hit the ties and keep going&quot; or she would &quot;get&quot; him. Previously, Frederick had protested &quot;Why, she even shot a hole through my coat&quot; to which the sassy Matilda snapped &quot;Well, didn&#8217;t I buy you the coat?!&quot; She&#8217;d also once visited him in his law office and shot him in the arm.  </p>
<p>Somehow&#8211;maybe he told them what his home life was like?&#8211;Frederick gave the detectives the slip. By late April, the Levees were both in New Orleans, Matilda seeking to hasten Frederick&#8217;s extradition. On arrival, she discovered that he had established a law office in the Maison Blanche Building in Canal Street, and had obtained one of those sneaky Louisiana divorces without her knowledge. She fumed and stalked him.</p>
<p>Finally on May 7 she lurked near the St. Charles Hotel until he came out and saw her. They spoke briefly, and as he turned away she&#8230; what, do you think, whipped the heck out of him? Oh no, whips are for women. Husbands get the gun. Before hundreds of witnesses Matilda shot Frederick in the back, causing his death. Clapped in jail yelling that she had done it to save other women the pain she had suffered, Matilda pled not guilty, and later filed an injunction against Lucius H. Levy, administrator of Frederick&#8217;s estate, to stop him from disposing of any property. </p>
<p>In March 1922, Matilda was sent to the East Louisiana hospital for the insane at Jackson. (We reckon that they have a slightly freer definition of madness in the south than in the Southland.) Released as cured in June 1923, last reports have her seeking control of her late husband&#8217;s extensive property holdings in Texas and California. </p>

But we are far from the Hotel Northern and Bunker Hill now, with a tale of love scorned ending up in a Louisiana madhouse. What of architect W.J. Saunders, a reinforced concrete specialist who made his name building the downtown lofts and warehouses which garnered deep fire insurance discounts for his clients? Among his notable projects were a charming Mission Style auto sales and service shop on Orange Street (1921, see drawing above), the remodeled <a href="http://cinematreasures.org/theater/3194/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lynn Theater</a> in Laguna Beach (1930, still in operation, and variously described as being French-Norman and Mayan) and a supermarket at Wilshire and Camden Drive (1933) built for screenwriter Louis D. Lighton (&quot;Wings,&quot; &quot;It&quot;).  Among his surviving commercial structures is the massive five-story New Method Laundry Company plant on the northeast corner of Sixth and San Julian (1910, see below), featuring rows of novel windows that began at five feet above the ground and reached to the ceiling. It still makes a striking facade, despite a wretched paint job and a couple of missing floors.<br>
<img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3081/2581679659_d5392ff571.jpg"></p>
<p><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3166/2581692005_7d8e2972b2.jpg"></p>
<p>But for his most unusual structure, Saunders served as his own client. This was the &quot;spite house,&quot; erected in 1907 at 2691 San Marino Street flush up against the property line of Saunders&#8217; neighbor Adolph Lowinsky, orchestra leader at the Angelus Hotel. This oddity was two stories high but only one room deep, with its staircase on the outside wall and no windows on the west side. </p>
<p>Lowinsky sputtered that this abomination existed purely to deprive his home of any natural light on the east side, and to block the view from his porch; other homeowners shared his revulsion at the bizarre addition to their block. Saunders countered &quot;I planned that house long before I ever knew Mr. Lowinsky. That is a flat building, and I believe it will prove lucrative!&quot; And anyway, Lowinsky had started it by pelting the Saunders children with stones and building an unsightly wall. Lowinsky further claimed that he and his day-sleeping wife had long been tortured by the Saunders brats, who rolled past the house on the sidewalk on noisy wagons, banged tin pans under their windows and yelled &quot;Sheeny&quot; whenever Lowinsky mowed his lawn. Saunders complained that Lowinsky pelted his children with pebbles, cursed at his wife and finally pointed a shotgun at him and threatened to blow his brains out. These battling neighbors aired their grubby laundry in a series of newspaper articles, but seem never to have actually sued or slain each other.. no doubt much to the disappointment of you, gentle reader.</p>
<p>You can today walk in Saunders&#8217; footsteps by joining his and the missus&#8217; club, the <a href="http://www.ruskinartclub.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ruskin Art Club</a> (founded 1888 and still active). But please be kinder to the guy next door.</p>

<p>The next time you take in a show at the Ahmanson Theater or the Mark Taper Forum, take a minute and think about the St Angelo Hotel. For 70 years the impressive Victorian structure dominated the corner of Grand and Temple where the Music Center now stands. From stately hotel to slum boarding house, the St Angelo represented Bunker Hill in all its glory and decline.</p>
<div style="text-align: center">
<img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3273/2585744865_34d4897a32.jpg?v=0" alt="St Angelo in its glory days" width="400">
</div>
<p>
The St. Angelo Hotel was built in 1887 by a Mrs. A.M. Smith who hoped to cash in on the big SoCal land boom of the 1880s, which brought countless migrants to the area. Like many structures built on the Hill during this period, the St Angelo was an elaborate Victorian building that the Los Angeles Times described as having “balconies with ornate woodwork and varicolored small squares of glass are in the upper parts of the windows.”&#157; As for the interior, the St. Angelo had “winding stairways which with other woodwork are of redwood”&#157; with “wide landings that are parlors on each floor.”&#157;  </p>
<div style="text-align: center">
<img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3002/2586580762_ffff3be005.jpg?v=0" alt="St Angelo " width="300">
</div>
<p></p>
<p>Unfortunately, Mrs. Smith&#8217;s timing was a bit off. When the St. Angelo opened, the booming 80s were winding down and the hotel did not fare as well as planned. In August 1889, the hotel was shut down by the sheriff due to an attachment on the property, but was able to reopen three months later. Mrs. Smith held onto the hotel for twelve years, waiting for prosperous times to return, but ultimately had to give up the property.</p>
<div style="text-align: center">
<img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3098/2585744977_b7c0cfff83.jpg?v=0" height="87" width="413">
</div>
<p>Prosperity did come to the St Angelo in the early years of the 20th Century and the hotel hosted many parties, weddings and conferences. Guests were frequently mentioned in the society pages. While the patrons of  the St. Angelo may have been of a more refined type, the same could not always be said of its employees. For example, there was no love lost between Mr. Cole, the hotel cook, and Mr. Brown another hotel employee, who were known to frequently spar. One day in March of 1902, all hell broke lose and Brown and Cole chased each other around the kitchen throwing, “catsup bottles, dining-room chairs, and other utensils that came handy.”&#157; The authorities were summoned and Brown was fined $5. </p>
<p>In 1904, Mrs. A.M. Smith came back in the picture when she realized that she legally still retained, as the L.A. Times reported, a strip of land “seven and one half feet, extending from Grand avenue to Bunker Hill avenue and passing directly under the St. Angelo.”&#157; The property owners demanded that she hand over the deed to this strip of land, but Mrs. Smith held out for the cash settlement. She finally made a profit on the St. Angelo.</p>

</div>
<p>No boarding house on Bunker Hill would be complete without a bit of death and mayhem. In 1906, Charles Malan, a Frenchman suffering from consumption and depleted funds, did himself in by sealing off all the doors and cracks of his room and turning on the gas. Then there is the sad story of Frederick Merrill, an 87 year old inventor and resident who slipped on a banana peel on Main Street and died from his injuries a couple of weeks later. Finally, in 1943 a fight broke out in the hotel&#8217;s lobby and Mrs. Mae Perry, the hotel manager, broke up the scuffle&#8230;with a gun. Rubio Ernesto, 17 and not a hotel guest was killed in the incident. </p>

<p>
By 1939, when a WPA census was conducted, the St. Angelo and its 57 units were in need of “major repairs.”&#157; As the Los Angeles Times noted, “it is an old wooden pile now proudly in decline, a genteel old building still snobbish among the smaller structures around it which were built not much later.”&#157; Despite the hotel&#8217;s shabby condition, it stood proudly on the Hill until the board of health ordered it vacated in 1956. All traces of the once grand hotel were soon erased and replaced by the Music Center which was dedicated in 1964. </p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Greetings!  My name is Eddie Quette, and the powers that be here at the Bunker Hill blog have requested that I write about proper behavior.  Every week, hundreds of letters pour into the blog, asking about table manners, social refinement, polite human interactions, good taste,  and the like.  My job is to extract from this pile the most tasteful, insightful, and intelligent letters.  Then  I throw those away and attempt  to respond  to the rest.</p>
<p>So, without further ado, let&#8217;s dip into the ol&#8217; mailbag and read our first letter. This comes to us from a<br>
longtime resident of Highland Park.</p>
<p>Q.  Hello, I&#8217;m from Highland Park&#8230;.</p>
<p>A. We KNOW that, numbskull!  It was in the intro!</p>
<p>A. Oh, sorry.  Anyway, I&#8217;ve oft put off or bowed out of a ganking, as I struggle with what I imagine are common questions:  is a pearl-handled<br>
firearm gauche before dusk?  Are they &quot;not done&quot; after Labor Day? Is an automatic more appropriate when holding up dinner parties than a revolver?  Can I wear a blued nickel piece with brown shoes?  Please advise!</p>
<p>A.  I can see you are a man of taste and breeding.  Offhand, my answers to your questions  would be  yes, yes, no, and yes, unless they&#8217;re Oxford brogans, in which case a mauve nickel piece would look more dashing. Also, keep in mind that High Society seems to be entering a &quot;Green&quot; phase, in which environmental consciousness has seeped into every social clique, even the Gangster set. Thus, whereas only  last season the byword was that steel-jacketed tracer shells were &quot;de rigeur,&quot; now the most fashionable shootists are employing recycled graphite shells, as they use less energy and don&#8217;t pollute landfills. (I know, a bullet is such a SMALL thing, but just think, if we ALL switched over, think how much of our country&#8217;s precious natural resources we could save!)</p>
<p>Q.  I&#8217;ve  just dumped a limbless torso on Norton Avenue in the Crenshaw district, and I need a cab ride out of town PRONTO! My question is, how much should I tip the taxi driver?</p>
<p>A.  The standard answer is of course 15%, but there are some  additional factors in your case. Remember you will be asking this hapless fellow to ignore all speed limit signs on the way out of town, so that should add at least another 10%.  Plus, you will want to teach him to repeat the phrase &quot;I ain&#8217;t seen nothin&#8217;&quot;  at least 5000 times to bumbling LAPD detectives and reporter Jack Smith, so that&#8217;s worth another 5%.  Also, you didn&#8217;t mention whether the limbs from the body are dripping  liquid evidence on the cabbie&#8217;s  floor;  if so,  it would be both gallant and prudent to tip  him with a bottle of New Improved Borateen Blood &amp; Gore Remover.</p>
<p>Q. My name is Phineas J. Marsak.  Recently certain rogues and scalawags have been spreading tasteless rumors about my alleged activities with animals at the pet store on 3rd and Flower.  How can I convince my Whist and Billiards partners at the Jonathan and California Clubs that these innuendoes are utterly baseless, and originate from persons of low degree?  You know how those  sheep  lie!</p>
<p>A.  Mr. Marsak, I must urge  you in the strongest possible terms to refrain from reproducing your kind, whether with human females or ruminants. Were the Marsak line to continue, there is no telling what horrors would befall our planet!</p>
<p>Q.  I&#8217;ve been interested for quite a while in some of the more adventurous social encounters available in the Bunker Hill area, and recently I was invited to a rendezvous on a lane near Pershing Square called Vaseline Alley.  My query is, is it proper to  R.S.V.P. with a  hand-written note?  Or a  phone call?  Or via a liveried messenger boy, perhaps wearing short  tight spandex bicycle pants?  Also, my City Directory doesn&#8217;t list a Zip Code for Vaseline Alley.  Please advise.</p>
<p>A.  Well, they certainly have a &quot;Zipper code.&quot;  Namely, when you see the cops rounding the corner, zip up your zipper!</p>
<p>Well, that&#8217;s all the advice Eddie can dish out this time. Tune in regularly for further installments of his column, and should you find yourself in need of a little guidance as only Mr. Quette can provide, simply <a href="/feedback">email</a> your inquiry, or send it by carrier pigeon to On Bunker Hill, Clay Street, Old Los Angeles.</p>

The Battle of <a href="http://www.britishbattles.com/bunker-hill.htm" title="BH" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bunker Hill</a>, 1775, was fought with the smoothbore flintlock musket, the odd Jäger rifle, and muzzleloading cannon of ship and field.  They also fought in formation, in the open, using the linear tactic–<i>both</i> sides (it”&#x2122;s a myth that during the Revolution the reb militia hid behind rocks and trees and picked off those Redcoats standing in a row).

The Battle of <a title="BH" href="http://www.britishbattles.com/bunker-hill.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bunker Hill</a>, 1775, was fought with the smoothbore flintlock musket, the odd Jäger rifle, and muzzleloading cannon of ship and field.

<p>In the apartment directly beneath them, R.V. Darby, the Mayor of Inglewood, president of the Federated Church Brotherhoods of Los Angeles, and owner of Kilz Exterminator Company was conducting a routine fumigation for bed bugs.</p>
<p>As always, he had notified the Health Department, and given written and verbal notice to all occupants of the building, asking them to leave their rooms and open the windows.  And as always, he was using cyanide gas.</p>
<p>While Darby worked, unbeknownst to him, deadly gas was seeping up into the Bowman&#8217;s apartment through a small hole in the floor around a steam pipe.  Both brothers were asphyxiated while they slept.</p>
<p>Darby&#8217;s license was temporarily suspended while a manslaughter complaint was brought before a grand jury to determine whether the Bowmans&#8217; deaths were caused by negligence on Darby&#8217;s part.  More than twenty witnesses testified, and on December 1, Darby was exonerated, the jury stating that the deaths were a tragic accident, but that Darby had taken all possible precautions.</p>

<p>In an era of spacious Victorian mansions, one could argue that the Touraine Apartments on Hope Street were 100 or so years ahead of their time. Erected in 1903 and opened in 1904, the units of this neoclassical building were designed to squeeze in a maximum number of tenants at market rates while presenting the illusion of roomy living quarters. At one point, residents were forcibly driven out in favor of higher renters. Before being demolished in the mid 1960s, the Touraine had survived a couple of fires, a colorful cast of characters, an amnesia inducing accident, and at least one suicide.  <br>
<!--break--><br>
<br>
Designed by architect A.L. Haley, who was also responsible for the Higgins Building on Main Street, the Touraine&#8217;s columned facade stood three stories high, while the rear of the structure was eight stories, sloping with the natural terrain of Bunker Hill. Aimed at attracting wealthy renters, the Touraine&#8217;s elegant grand staircase lead up to a large rooftop garden and sun room. Unlike other boarding houses and mansions on the Hill which contained spacious muti-roomed residences, the Touraine&#8217;s apartments claimed to have all the functions of seven rooms squeezed into two, plus a kitchen. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the Los Angeles Examiner, the floor-plan “shows a parlor, a living room, a kitchen, a private hall, a private bath and a storage closet. Apparently there are no bedrooms or dining room.”&#157; The beds actually folded into the wall. One could be disguised as a mantle during the day, the other as a large plate glass mirror.  A writing desk and bookcase were built into a door that concealed a large closet and the dining room table could be folded and hung up. The kitchen contained swinging doors with the stove attached, so that once the cooking was done, the door could be swung out into the living room and the stove used as a heater. </p>
<p>The building, which would have traditionally housed six or seven units contained twenty eight. The inventors of the floor plan were so impressed with their design that they patented the plan, as well as the built-in appliances.   The gimmick of having the comforts of seven rooms in two was successful, and the Touraine Apartments became a fashionable residence for many wealthy patrons. Apparently, they were not wealthy enough.</p>

<p>The Great Touraine Siege of March 1906 began when hired landlady Estella Palmer collected rent and utility payments from all the tenants and promptly skipped town. Despite having proof of payment, part owner, F.W. Marshall demanded that the residents repay the full amount. Looking to replace the current tenants with higher paying ones, Marshall had no problem turning off the electricity, gas and telephones when the residents refused to double pay. Holding their ground, the tenants lived by candle light and hired lawyers, proclaiming to the Herald newspaper that the landlords “are only waiting the chance to cut off our heads.”&#157; When the water was cut, many residents found they could not tolerate the unsanitary conditions, caved in and moved out. For those who refused to move, Marshall took to breaking into their apartments when they were out and removing all their personal belongings. By the end of the weeklong confrontation, all the residents had been forced out. Apparently, tenants rights had not been established at the turn of the century. A local apartment building sought to capitalize on the stand-off by advertising that residents would not be “Tourained”&#157; at their establishment. Two months after the incident, the remodeled Touraine re-opened and the owners advertised in the Los Angeles Times for five straight months trying to lure wealthier renters.</p>

During its six decades the Tournaine suffered two fires. The first in 1905 was caused by what the Times described as an “immense pile of rubbish in the storeroom.”&#157; The second in 1932 was started when a jilted boyfriend decided to enact revenge on his ex by setting her entire building on fire. Both blazes were minor and resulted in no injuries.</p>

</div>
<p>Like any good Bunker Hill boarding house, the Touraine had its fair share of shady dealings. In 1931, a prospective renter parked his car in front of the building while he ran inside to make lodging arrangements, only to have the auto stolen from under his nose. Dr. John Klutho provided the building with its token suicide by shooting himself in his room in 1934. A few months later, Effie Laurelle Doll sued the owners when a routine fumigation made her violently ill. The judge and jury decided they need to visit the building before making a final decision. By 1956 the Touraine&#8217;s residents were not as elite as they had once been. This was demonstrated when two tenants were arrested for knocking over a local liquor store.</p>
<p>But, of all the goings on at the Touraine, the most bizarre was the case of Miss Ruby Jester.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style="text-align: center">

<p>Ruby Jester was a Southern Bell who in August 1911 announced her engagement to local aviator and academic Sigurd Russell. Shortly after the announcement, Miss Jester, while living at the Touraine, was knocked unconscious after she fainted at the top of the grand staircase and tumbled down it. When she came to, Ruby was struck with amnesia, and claimed to have forgotten all of 1911. She believed that she was still in Atlanta, didn&#8217;t recognize her surroundings or neighbors,  and, even worse,  had no clue who her fiancee was!  Less than a month after getting engaged to Sigurd Russell, she was indeed married&#8230;but not to Russell.  Instead, she wed Jack Tilford, her childhood sweetheart whom she clearly remembered. According to the LA Times, dejected Russell “holds no ill will towards his successful rival. He wished them both all happiness.”&#157;</p>
<p>By 1939, the 28 efficient apartments had been divided into 56 units. By 1964 the Touraine was gone.   <br>
