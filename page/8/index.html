		<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3076/2893499723_9b26dc3ceb_o.gif" alt="1313" width="300" height="227">They were eastern European immigrants, utterly integrated into the ways of American society. They were doting, loving parents; rarely does television depict such a highly functional family. They were the Munsters, and they existed to teach us valuable, eternal lessons: build hot rods out of hearses and caskets. Let your home be overrun by the <a title="DoTheRingo" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-015FRQzMA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Standells</a> and their beatnik <a title="FerusGallery64" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MHiPrVfdgM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">buddies</a>. And see that your house is the biggest and spookiest on the block.</p>
<p>Aside from these eternal lessons, the Munsters also represented something particular to their time—to be exact, Sept.’64-May ’66. (No, I’m not talking about that despite their status as affable, upstanding citizens, the average American really didn’t want to live next door to someone whose skin was a <i>different color</i>.) For our purposes I want to look at another member of the Munster clan, the house itself: 1313 Mockingbird Lane.<br>
<img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3133/2893499679_b037385c45_o.gif" alt="MunsterPcard" width="355" height="550"></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3115/2894340956_3815b99529_o.gif" alt="lightningflash" width="350" height="262" align="right">The Munster manse is important to our topic at hand because it represents the attitude toward Victorian architecture at the time the CRA was in its wholesale frenzy of demolition: in a world blooming with Cliff May and Eichler knock-offs, <a title="not1164" href="https://www.1164.com/munsters/1965/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1313</a> was an ungainly, awkward embarrassment. It was, to many, nothing if not downright frightening. And those who would live in such a place? They must be odd in the extreme. Beyond curious. Again, frightening: those who dare knock on that door usually end up vaulting themselves over the gate and running down the street in terror. Besides having skin of a different color (in this case, green), the dwellers therein are, in fact, <i>monsters</i>.</p>
<p>The Addams Family also had a big creepy house, though it was more a museum (as noted in theme song, of course) than mired in decrepitude. If the Addams examination of landed gentry’s eccentricities has any bearing on Bunker Hill, it is only in illuminating the Bunker Hill of yore—therein lies no bearing on the Bunker Hill of 1965. (Interestingly, the shot of the Addams house in the first episode was filmed down at <a href="https://21chesterplace.com/">21 Chester Place</a> [and is now, sadly, demolished].)</p>
<p>The house at Chester Place, and its matte-painted addition:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3081/2894254538_aac920d695_o.gif" alt="HousedAddams" width="350" height="262"></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3128/2894257182_0b9988ca0c_o.gif" alt="theeasywaytoaddon" width="350" height="276"></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3163/2894257336_b947b38d98_o.gif" alt="001CemeteryRidge" width="350" height="262" align="left">Nevertheless, while one could view Gomez as a demented Doheny, or a cracked Crocker, perhaps because (Charles) Addams’s work is so associated with the New Yorker, there’s something rather <i>East Coast</i> about the Addamses. After all, the Italianate Addams place was modeled after a house from Chas’s New Jersey boyhood, or a building at U-Penn, depending on whom you ask.</p>
<p>There’s something uniquely Angeleno about the Munsters—when you take the <a title="MunsterKoach" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EboexI0JbiQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Koach</a> out to <a title="MHDS" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMLZNwezGFY&amp;feature=related" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mockingbird Heights drag strip</a>, you can smell the Pomona. The Munsters went to <a title="SomethingLovable" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giEvrdTr_NY&amp;feature=related" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marineland</a>. Herman hung with Dodger manager <a title="Durocher" href="https://www.conelrad.com/mutatedtelevision/hermanmunster.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leo Durocher</a>.<br>
<img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3246/2894341448_2cf12176e9_o.gif" alt="TheGreatTour" width="575" height="365"><br>
1313 was every bit Bunker Hill—dig the deep central Gothic-arched porch, the extensive use of shabby shingle, the patterned chimney. The asymmetrical double porches and widow’s walk are a nice touch. Its most notable feature might be the spook-faced gable. And inside; no well-intentioned postwar updates there—all spindlework and heavy drapes and art-glass lamps. The crumbling stone gates, the overgrowth…this was disrepair in all its Gesamkunstwerkiness. The gag, of course, was that 1313 was the one and only of its kind on the block. The standout. The sore thumb. Bunker Hill was a <i>nest</i> of these things.</p>
<p>Making matters worse, a Munster stood for something. A Munster stood for his home, protecting it with his or her life (undead though they may be). In “Munster on the Move,”&#157; (Season 1, Episode 27, airdate March 25, 1965) Herman gets a promotion at the parlor whereby the family must sell the house and move to Buffalo. Grandpa inadvertently sells to a wrecking company; when the Munsters find out the house’s fate, they put the good of the house before their own self-interest. When the bulldozers show up, the family is out front, cannons packed with Grandma’s best silver. The head of the wrecking crew shakes his head in disgust, but not disbelief; says it reminds him of the little old ladies who threw themselves in front of the bulldozers when they were tearing down their homes for the freeway system. “Look Jack, I bought this place to wreck it and put in a parking lot. Now move it, because we’re coming through.”&#157; After the wreckers see that Herman can swing a wrecking ball around, they turn tail and flee.</p>
<p>Wreckers arrive:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3205/2894340874_a58a2b0457_o.gif" alt="TheArrival" width="575" height="433"></p>
<p>Herman reasons with them to great effect:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3268/2893500167_f9a7560e14_o.gif" alt="ManOfReason" width="575" height="444"></p>
<p>Bunker Hill had its <a title="HermansLegacy" href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/duelingbabcocks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Frank Babcock</a>, but even he was no Herman Munster.</p>
<p>One last thing. In “Herman Munster, Shutterbug,”&#157; (Season 2, Episode 4, October 7, 1965) Herman inadvertently snaps a photo of two bandits running out of the Mockingbird Heights Bank. And where do these bank-robbing low-lifes lay low? We see in an establishing shot that they’re staying at “The Grand”&#157;—</p>

<p>The Hotel Trenton, seven stories of sober brick laced with fire escapes, its yawning central maw somewhere between a gate of hell and a jaunty fireman&#8217;s doorway, lurked low on Bunker Hill for many decades. There it is at 10 o&#8217;clock in the panorama. It was not a racy hotel, but it had its moments, and left an imprint on the fabric of its times.</p>
<p><img src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3018/2888657343_94f46e00ef_o.png"><br>
And speaking of imprints, it was July 1905 when a lady guest of the establishment marched into to the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> offices to report her dismay at having ruined her long white skirt, white stockings and slippers when she walked over the streetcar tracks at First and Broadway and picked up a liberal helping of petroleum, which the cars&#8217; operators had smeared on the rails to deafen the screech which otherwise came whenever a curve was taken. A snarky <i>Times</i> reporter noted that had the lady been as eager to lift her skirts when crossing the tracks as she was to show off the damage caused by the oil—&quot;and it&#8217;s higher up, too!&quot;—she would not be in such a predicament.</p>
<p><img src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3120/2889484804_7d17c1f50e_o.jpg"></p>
<p>In May 1906, town gossips received confirmation of a scandal, but too late to shun anyone involved. Some months earlier, Mrs. Genevieve Hughes arrived in Los Angeles from Denver and took rooms in the Trenton, where she was paid significant attention by fellow guest, Boston lawyer Charles W. Ward. Ward was briefly a Harvard man who took his degree from Columbia, a gymnast, a Knight Templar and a soldier, every inch the eligible young fellow&#8230; well, almost. Again and again he would ask that she marry him, and always she would demur—but not refuse his friendship. On February 28, Ward went into his room and shot himself in the head, and the whispers said it was out of thwarted love for Genevieve. The lady, however, had eyes for another, and quietly married A.G. Jones, also of Boston, departing for an Eastern honeymoon before news of the nuptials spread. And as for Ward, he was, it proved, a bounder, having left a wife and children awaiting the return of his health under the Californian sun. He lingered a few days after being shot, but died before his father could arrive by train.</p>
<p><img src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3108/2889484812_de0df72fd1.jpg"></p>
<p>In November 1907, Mexican Secret Service officer (and soon-to-be fink in the trial of revolutionary countrymen <a href="https://www.sandiegohistory.org/journal/99winter/magonista.htm" target="_blank">Magon</a>, Rivera and Villareal) Trinidad Vasquez left the safe harbor of the Trenton for a meal in a restaurant at Fifth and Olive. He had a ham and cheese sandwich and a cup of coffee, returned to the hotel and walked out again. In front of the Police Station, Vazquez was stricken with symptoms of poisoning and rushed to Receiving Hospital, where his stomach was pumped. Relieved, Vasquez testified that soon after eating he had felt a sense of suffocation, then felt as though his very heart would burst before blackness washed over him. He was soon released, doubtless with a greater respect for the fervor of the anarchist community of Los Angeles.</p>
<p>In early February 1909 it was revealed that the Trenton&#8217;s recently hired night clerk Harry Stevens was in fact Florin G. Lee, a Riverside lad who&#8217;d suffered a breakdown from overwork (dry goods clerking by day, electrical engineering study by night) or, some whispered, love unrequited, on December 30 and fled his home, shaking off all memory of his former life. When confronted by old friends, who said they knew him well, Stevens/ Lee expressed astonishment, and mused on his happier times in Iowa and Butte, Montana, and his New Years Day rail trip to Los Angeles over the Salt Lake Route. Conveyed to Riverside, he looked with bemusement upon his aged grandmother and treated the rest of the family with cordial unfamiliarity. He did not recognize the shop where he clerked for nine years, the books he had kept (quite well) or respond to the music which he formerly had loved. For two months, the stranger stayed on in Riverside as those who loved him tried to spark a memory of his past life. And then suddenly, on April 2, while in the dry goods store where he had long labored, Florin&#8217;s memory of his accounting work came flooding back. He raced to San Bernardino to share the happy, mathematical news with his father, and we hear no more about him.</p>
<p>On the evening of August 6, 1912, an &quot;elevator pilot&quot; was sent down to the basement to fetch some ice water. On the way up poked he his head out as the cage made its ascent. The ice water went everywhere, and so did the poor lad&#8217;s cranium. So complete was the destruction that there was initially some confusion when night clerk E.G. Merrifield came on the scene as to whether the dead man was Charles J. Oberman or his colleague, Earl Ansley. The victim was actually, it transpired, Earl McDonald, 18, from Riverside, who was moonlighting under the name Earl C. Ansley at the Trenton and working a day shift at the Hotel Victoria at Seventh at Hope. It was his first night on the job, and hotel manager R. Hughes was later charged for violating the state law requiring all elevator operators be properly licensed. </p>
<p>On February 3, 1913, S. W. Westmeyer, a successful mining man from Globe, Arizona, visited his wife at the Trenton and wrote her a check for $1025. From there, he went to the Hotel Redondo in Redondo Beach, where, the following evening, he shot himself in the head. Westmeyer left notes giving his personal effects to his wife and asking that his Lodge, Rescue No. 12 of the International Order of Odd Fellows in Globe be notified of his passing. </p>
<p>Later that month, the Trenton figured in the notorious jury tampering case of the great attorney Clarence Darrow, who rang up large charges at the hotel for select jurymen, far in excess of the $9 weekly rate that investigators were quoted—though it was the thirty dollars in ten cent cigars that got the jury&#8217;s goat.</p>
<p>In October 1915, resident Marie Kinney announced that she was moving her dressmaking parlor from the Fay Building at Third and Hill to the Trenton, and noted that help was wanted. A year later, she announced her winter reopening in suites 102-103-104, crowing &quot;choicest novelties in stock.&quot; Marie must have liked the place, for it was still her home on Valentine&#8217;s Day 1941, when, aged 80, she stepped in front of a Pacific Electric car on Huntington Drive near Poplar in El Sereno, and was killed instantly. Her rosary was said at Cunningham &amp; O&#8217;Conner at 1031 South Grand, requiem mass held at St. Vibiana&#8217;s and she was interred at Calvary.</p>
<p>In October 1917 the Los Angeles Division of the Collegiate Periodical League began a monthly drive to collect 5000 magazines, none older than ten days, for distribution among the servicemen at Camp Lewis. Among the district captains was Mrs. Alice M. Bryant of the Hotel Trenton. Your blogger will now attempt to staunch the drool inspired by the thought of what was gathered.</p>
<p>Late on December 2, 1930, the Trenton was among a trio of downtown hotels robbed by a pair of bandits in a taxicab. After they hit the Stillwell at 9th and Grand for $30 and a pair of guest handbags, unknowing driver George Kruger waited patiently outside the Trenton while night clerk A. E. Finnity and manager Herbert Perry were relieved of another $30. Finally the Victor Hotel at 616 South St. Paul was victim, and again yielded up a lucky thirty simolians. The thieves then paid their ferryman and slipped off into the night.</p>
<p>By 1933, we note that rooms were being let for a modest $3.50 a week. On June 8, 1936, Arnie J. Powers, 42, shot himself to death in his room, having failed to recover his health after coming out from Omaha.</p>
<p><img src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3095/2889484808_7d730923e2_o.jpg"><br>
On June 14, 1937 the Trenton hosted its most eloquent suicide, when retired schoolteacher Mrs. Ida Mae Mills, 70, gassed herself with a chloroform-soaked rag alongside an open copy of the book <i>The Right to Die.</i> Her note read, &quot;Remember this—Death should be a smooth finish, not a jagged interruption. There is nothing mysterious nor dramatic about this. Neither was it conceived in a moment of desperation. I think I am as sane as I ever was, but I have long been convinced of the wisdom of mercy killing. Why must I live on, tortured by constant pain, and facing total blindness? My abject apologies to the management for the trouble I am giving them, but I had to have some place to die, didn&#8217;t I? I could not vanish into the air.&quot;</p>
<p>She could not, but sometime in the early 1960s, it seems, the Trenton Hotel did just that. We can only assume the CRA had a little something to do with that.</p>

Harry L. Redd was crawling around beneath the city streets attempting to repair a telephone wire, but it was so dark he couldn’t see a thing. He’d been catching a whiff of gas fumes for the past few days in the same location, yet without thinking he fumbled around in his pockets until he found a match. He scraped the match across his trousers and, KABOOM!<span> </span><!--break-->

The force of the explosion hurled him back against some pipes. The injured man was snapped back to his senses when a second blast thrust him out of the manhole and into the street. He was so violently tossed around that he rolled for a few feet, and then fell backwards through the manhole. Unbelievably, although badly burned, Harry survived.

<p style="margin: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
Several bystanders were hurt, including a small boy named Albert Adams who had been attracted to the site moments before the blast. He’d been walking down the street when he noticed the open manhole. Albert was curious and had poked his head into the hole to see what was going on when the first detonation occurred. The lucky young man escaped with nothing more serious than singed eyebrows.
</p>
<p>The eruption was so powerful that a heavy iron manhole cover at Fourth and Hill Streets flew up into the air and flipped over several times before returning to Earth. The only building to suffer damage was at 331 South Hill where the windows were shattered.Â <p>Â </p><p></p>Â <p></p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'">To avoid this kind of accident in the future, maybe we’d better review a couple of childhood lessons: don’t run with scissors, don’t put anything bigger than your elbow up your nose, and never light a match if you smell gas.</span></p>

<p>Harold J. McAnally of 230 South Flower (the <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/vanfleet" title="vanfleet" target="_blank">Van Fleet Apartments</a>) tried to buy a drink for a woman in the bar, when he was pushed from his barstool by a jealous rival.Â  McAnally fell, cracking his head on the bar&#8217;s concrete floor and fracturing his skull.Â  As you can see in the picture here, though McAnally is lying prone on the ground, no one seems to be all that concerned.Â  Perhaps the regulars were callous, or didn&#8217;t care for him, but it&#8217;s also possible that McAnally was already dead, and nothing was left to be done.</p>
<p>He arrived DOA at the Georgia Receiving Hospital, and shortly thereafter, Frank Swope, 33, turned himself in to the police, confessing that he was the one who had shoved McAnally at the bar.Â  Swope hadn&#8217;t meant to hurt him; he was just angry about McAnally&#8217;s flirtation.</p>

<p>Bunker Hill Avenue was probably the most picturesque street in the neighborhood of the same name. The avenue was much more narrow than the other streets and was lined with some of the most impressive mansions on the Hill. Compared to most of its neighbors, the house that stood at 339 South Bunker Hill was farily modest and came to be affectionately known as the Salt Box. Despite being considerably less grand than the other Victorian beauties on the street, the Salt Box was saved from the wrecking ball and moved to a new location to stand as a tangible monument of the rapidly vanishing community. Unfortunately, the charming structure that stood for eighty years on its original location, only lasted a few months at its new home.</p>

<i>1888 &amp; 1906 Sanborn Maps showing construction of homes, and finished products</i>

<p>
The Salt Box was built on Lot 14, Block L of the Mott Tract, which was two doors down from a grand mansion that came to be known as the <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/castle">Castle.</a> The 1888 Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps shows the two buildings as being constructed, as well as the residence between them. Since Rueben M. Baker owned the lots, he was probably responsible for the construction of all three houses. Baker resided at the <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/castle">Castle</a> until 1894 and possibly rented out the Salt Box until selling it to Ada Frances Weyse and her husband Rudolph in 1892.</p>

<p>
The Weyses also rented out the Salt Box, which appeared to have been converted into a muti-resident boarding house as early as 1891,with rooms constantly being advertised in the classifieds. Joseph L. Murphey and his wife, Augusta, purchased the home in 1902, but it is unclear if they lived in the house or merely took over landlord duties. </p>

In 1900, the house at 330 S Bunker Hill was home to two households. By 1910, the Salt Box had been divided up into seven separate units which housed families as well as single tenants. In 1920 there were ten units and by 1939 the house had been further divided into thirteen separate residences. Those who called the Salt Box their home came from all walks of life and included painters, nurses, waiters, and of course pensioners who could afford rents that were as little as $9.75 per month.</p>

<p>
Compared to the shenanigans taking place at other boarding houses on Bunker Hill, the Salt Box had a rather serene existence. With the exception of resident Annie Prendergast, who was hit by a car at the corner of 4th and Grand and killed, the residents of the Salt Box lived quiet lives, until the Community Redevelopment Agency (CRA) came knocking.</p>

By 1968, all of the once proud Victorians of Bunker Hill Avenue had been demolished, except for the <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/castle">Castle</a> and the Salt Box. The two structures that had been constructed at the same time had been spared.Â  Once the CRA began pushing forward with their grand redevelopment plan in the mid-1950s, the writing was on the wall for the mansions in the neighborhood, and in an attempt to save a couple of the structures, the Salt Box was declared Historic Cultural Monument #5 in October in August 1962. Designation was soon bestowed upon the <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/castle">Castle</a> which became HCM #27 in May 1964. The rest of the decade was spent trying to figure out a way to spare the two structures from the wrecking ball.</p>

</div>
<p>
At the end of 1968, the decision was finally reached to move the <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/castle">Castle</a> and Salt Box to Highland Park in an area called Heritage Square. The pair of structures were relocated to their new home in March of 1969 and awaited restoration. These grand plans for the faded beauties were never realized because in October of 1969, vandals torched both houses and eighty years of history were wiped out in a matter of minutes.</p>

		<p>From the files of &quot;Where&#8217;d that law come from?&quot; we turn to Section 11352.1b of the California Health and Safety Code, which makes it illegal to sell &quot;any material represented as, or presented in lieu of, any dangerous drug or dangerous device.&quot;</p>
<p>The story behind the legislation takes us to a Chinatown street in the early 1950s where two undercover police from the narcotics division were attempting to score marijuana, and arranged a &quot;hand-to-hand go&quot; of $300 for 5 pounds of &quot;manicured tea.&quot;Â  They had their street lingo down, but I&#8217;m sure you can see where this is going.Â  The dealer took their money, and proceeded to hand over exactly what he&#8217;d promised &#8212; 5 pounds of tea.Â  At those prices, let&#8217;s hope he at least sprung for Twinings.</p>
<p>Once the crime lab revealed their folly, the two officers rushed back to Chinatown to arrest the enterprising young dealer until realizing that they didn&#8217;t know what to arrest him for.Â  Finally, they settled on the somewhat dubious charge of grand theft. </p>
<p>At first, there was some concern that undercover police officers would have to make their buys using specific, literal language, tipping off any half-wise dealer to their ruse.Â  An apoplectic police force lobbied the California legislature for provisions that would prevent this kind of misunderstanding in the future, and in 1953, they got their wish.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3173/2864766814_d463f951a4_o.jpg" alt="bellhoptrial" width="250" align="left" height="186">One of the firstÂ  people to stand trial under the new law was a resident of our very own Bunker Hill, Conrado M. Fragoso, a bellhop at 244 South Figueroa.Â  Fragoso arranged to sell $10 of a substance he referred to only as &quot;junk&quot; or &quot;stuff&quot; to Officer Manuel Gutierrez.Â  The &quot;junk&quot; in question was nothing but headache powder twisted into small paper bindles.Â  As the arrest took place on April 1, 1954, Fragoso missed his opportunity to declare the whole thing an April Fool, and was arrested.</p>
<p>At his trial, the public defender argued that Fragoso had never claimed to be selling heroin, as he never uttered the word; however, the judge was unmoved.Â  In 1954, a conviction for selling a substance under the pretense that it was a narcotic substance carried a sentence of up to one year in the County Jail.</p>

(One could argue there are few sights as telling when it comes to defining Los Angeles in general.)  But while we’re all familiar with those 42 stories of mid-60s glory, who remembers what stood <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=445+S+Figueroa+St,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90071&amp;sll=34.056197,-118.253767&amp;sspn=0.008658,0.013819&amp;layer=c&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=34.055948,-118.254004&amp;spn=0.008658,0.013819&amp;t=h&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr&amp;cbll=34.052451,-118.257033" title="there" target="_blank">there</a> before?  It was that hitherto unsung monument of Los Angeles deco:  the Monarch Hotel.<img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3080/2854380661_5b4d880015_o.gif" alt="monarkedelic" height="518" width="400"></p>
<p>
The Monarch opened in mid-October, 1929.  It contained sixty-six hotel rooms, fourteen single apartments, twelve double apartments, a five-room bungalow on the roof, three private roof decks planted rich with shrubbery, and a lobby embellished with hand-decorated ceilings.  It was entirely furnished by Barker Brothers with furniture of “modern type and design.”&#157;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3256/2854930762_6002240a16_o.gif" alt="modernistic" height="512" width="354"></p>
<p>From the outset, crime dogged the Monarch.  Sort of.  The first occupants of the bridal suite, in November 1929, were Motorcycle Officer Bricker of Georgia-Street Traffic Investigation and former Miss Losa Pope (the now newly-minted Mrs. Bricker, a purchasing agent at Forest Lawn).  <br>
<img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3204/2854943210_fc884285d1_o.gif" alt="loveatfirsthandcuff" height="130" width="486"><br>
They met when he had arrested her for speeding.  On their first morning together as Man and Wife, breakfasting on the roof garden outside their bridal suite, they were mobbed by twenty some-odd members of the Force who decided to burst in and make merry with fellow officer and his tamed scofflaw.</p>
<p>Real crime did, in fact, visit upon the Monarch.  (This may have had something to do with opening two weeks before the Crash.)  For example:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3166/2854943232_c5f52daa7f_o.gif" alt="betrayal" align="right" height="97" width="200">Night clerk H. N. Willey was behind the desk at the Monarch when, just after midnight on June 16, 1930, a bandit robbed him of $26. Willey phoned Central Station.  Meanwhile, officers Doyle and Williams, on patrol, observed a man hightailing it through an auto park near the hotel.  Deciding that he wasn’t running for his health (this being some years before the jogging craze), they gave chase and caught him in an alley.  They next observed a patrol car flying to the Monarch.  Putting two and two together, they took their prisoner to the hotel, where he was id’d by Willey.  Turns out he was George H. Hall, 24, a recent arrival in Los Angeles.  </p>
<p>H. N. Willey continued to ply the night clerk trade, and was doing so when two men entered on the early morning of August 31, 1931.  When Willey showed them to their room, they pulled out a gun and tried to lock him in the closet.  The attempt failed because the door had no outside lock, so the hapless crooks ran downstairs, recovered the $2 they had paid for the room and fled.</p>
<p>H. N. makes the papers again in November of 1931, when on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving Los Angeles is hit by a massive crime wave, in which over a dozen brazen robberies of hotels, groceries, theaters, pedestrians, folks in autos, etc. are shot at and robbed; Willey looks down the barrel of a large-bore automatic and forks over $25.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3195/2854995180_a1ef156c22_o.gif" alt="drinkup" height="679" width="505"><br>
One thing that’s nice about the Monarch?  It’s nice to have a bar downstairs.  Edgar Lee Smith lived, and drank, at the Monarch.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3099/2854108157_ef5e354468_o.gif" alt="deltadawn" align="right" height="139" width="231"><br>
August 23, 1946.  Smith, 51, had been drinking in the Monarch bar but neglected to keep to the cardinal rule of always keeping on the good side of one’s bartender.  This resulted in an after-hours duel that left his bartender, James Donald Chaffee, 28, stabbed to death.  When the Radio Officers Hill and Finn found Chaffee’s body on sidewalk, they went to Smith’s room, where they found him changing his clothes, and seized a penknife with a one-inch blade.</p>
<p>The fight began when, according to Smith, “Jimmy got sore because I stole his girl.”&#157;  Smith added that barkeep Chaffee, in retaliation, cut Smith off.  Smith, in counter-retaliation, cut Chaffee.  <br>

Smith plead guilty to manslaughter and was sentenced to one to ten in San Quentin.</p>

Gilbert Carvajal was a 17 year-old Marine stationed at Del Mar, part of Pendleton.  He was at the Monarch on May 9, 1957, with his 45 year-old lady-friend Frances Nishperly when it all began.  It was 1:15am and he decided it wise to hold up night clerk Frost E. Stacklager (H. N. Willey having retired, apparently) and make off with $22 and jewelry.  A few minutes later the two robbed the <a href="https://www.apartmentratings.com/rate/CA-Los-Angeles-Bixel-House-775810.html" title="625sBix" target="_blank">Trent Hotel</a> of $57.50; despite holding the clerk at knifepoint, the two next fled the <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=549+Wall+St,+90013&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=66.281516,113.203125&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=34.045583,-118.246472&amp;spn=0.008659,0.013819&amp;t=h&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr" title="wallst" target="_blank">Floyd Hotel</a> empty-handed, but snagged $45 from the till at the <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=605+w+27th+los+angeles+ca&amp;sll=34.057459,-118.261986&amp;sspn=0.008657,0.013819&amp;layer=c&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=34.028762,-118.276169&amp;spn=0.00433,0.006909&amp;t=h&amp;z=17&amp;iwloc=addr&amp;cbll=34.027158,-118.276828&amp;panoid=V_0H_NAwSYsEgKF1V6Xhaw" title="autoclub" target="_blank">Auto Club Hotel</a> minutes later.

Ms. Nishperly insisted Carvajal had kidnapped her from the corner of <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=W+Pico+Blvd+%26+S+Hope+St,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90015&amp;sll=34.040587,-118.265719&amp;sspn=0.008659,0.013819&amp;layer=c&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=34.040587,-118.265719&amp;spn=0.008659,0.013819&amp;t=h&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr&amp;cbll=34.03952,-118.26571&amp;panoid=V_0H_NAwSYsEgKF1V6Xhaw" title="abducted" target="_blank">Pico Blvd. and Hope St</a>., but police elected to discount this story.</p>

Now, people are forever plunging off the precipices afforded by tall structures (a quick peruse of On Bunker Hill proves that) and that’s a person’s right and due.  But it’s different when it’s an excited doggy.</p>
<p>Buddy was one such excitable pooch, who went nuts and ran right off the top of the Monarch Hotel!  Of course the Hand of God intervened, and Buddy—a 2 year-old fox terrier&#8211;fell one hundred feet, landing atop an auto roof, but emerged without a scratch, May 1, 1931.  (Apparently Buddy had landed on one of the small unbraced portions of the auto top; parking station attendants ran out when they heard a windshield smash and found a confused dog standing on top the machine, looking for a place to descend.)</p>
<p>Buddy’s daddy, Jimmy Van Scoyoe, was looking frantically for his pooch and had no idea of his aerial adventure when he peered off the roof and saw his Buddy surrounded by a puzzled crowd.  Jimmy is reported to have tightly clasped Buddy in his arms and vowed to never let him out of his sight again “even if I have to keep him in bed with me when I go to sleep.”&#157;  Damn straight!</p>

<p>Who loves the lost Monarch?  People are quick to fetishize the felled Richfield Tower, and with good reason (I, too, am an ardent obsessive—even owning parts of it); but isn’t it a bit…New York?  Doesn’t it owe a major debt to <a href="https://www.aviewoncities.com/nyc/americanradiatorbuilding.htm" title="TheARB" target="_blank">Hood’s American Radiator</a> Building?  Sure, some might argue that the Streamline Moderne is more natively Angeleno, but not only was that industrial-inspired application an Internationalist movement, but one also feels in its nautical element a particular evocation of our neighbor to the north, San Francisco.</p>
<p>What is elementally endemic to the land, <i>here</i>, is the Ziggurat Moderne of the Monarch Hotel—that there is something in the setback style that elicits a feeling for the indigenous, the “really”&#157; American, in that the mock-Mayan comes closest to the true architecture of this part of the world.  The core of this argument comes, of course, from <a href="https://davidszondy.com/future/city/mujica.htm" title="mujica" target="_blank">Francisco Mujica</a>’s   1929 <i>History of the Skyscraper</i>, where he hints at just that—that pre-Columbian pyramids are the correct expression of modernity, and vice versa (hence the natural evolution of the 1916 New York setback laws…glorious mother of what Koolhaas termed the <a href="https://thenonist.com/index.php/thenonist/permalink/hugh_ferriss_delineator_of_gotham/" title="avoidthenoid" target="_blank">Ferrissian Void</a>).   </p>
<p>Thus—where one might see the Monarch as somewhat <i>squat</i>:<br>
<img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3194/2854995534_67ca611772_o.gif" alt="nomaggieolmec" height="828" width="534"><br>
&#8230;we should take that as <i>monumentality</i> in its most impressive (if not oppressive, if that’s what reverberates in your Incan blood) form.</p>
<p>1906, the NW corner of Fifth and Figueroa at bottom right:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3096/2854943662_4793ede7dc_o.gif" alt="fifthandfig1906" height="358" width="575"></p>
<p>1950, twenty years after the installation of the Monarch:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3005/2854943596_d53bc755bd_o.gif" alt="theMonarchisintheHouse" height="366" width="575"></p>
<p>1953, with the addition of the Harbor Freeway:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3084/2854931256_7d1cea9894_o.gif" alt="harbornot" height="379" width="575"></p>
<p>After fifteen years of <i>Sturm n Drang</i>, on February 3, 1964, the $350 million Bunker Hill Urban Renewal Project got its first bite—Connecticut General Life offered $3.3 million for the block-square site that housed the Monarch Hotel.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3076/2854943558_932ecc371a_o.gif" alt="sold" height="146" width="575"></p>
<p>CRA Chairman William T. Sesnon Jr., expressed his elation:  “The sale is virtually completed.  We are overjoyed by this development.  It’s our hope it will serve as the real kickoff for the entire Bunker Hill project.”&#157;</p>
<p>Thirty days later—March 4, 1964:<br>
<img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3101/2854095639_f2bd92c544_o.gif" alt="downitgoes" height="661" width="400"></p>
<p>On March 30, 1965, red-jacketed attendants ushered dignitaries under a white-fringed canopy, where they watched a bulldozer tear up some concrete.  “Welcome to Bunker Hill—at last,”&#157; proclaimed Sesnon.  “This is the start of something dramatic.”&#157;<br>
<img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3079/2854096533_4e41e2b3d8_o.gif" alt="monarchacrossfremont" height="450" width="575"></p>

Some of the luster of Sesnon’s kickoff was dulled when in 1966—with the Union Bank half built—City Administrative Officer C. Erwin Piper and his staff issued a scathing report on the CRA.  It sited faulty operational control, an absence of clear-cut policies and poor internal coordination, at terrific taxpayer expense.  By the end of 1967 no more land had been disposed of, the CRA had lost half its department heads, had no executive director, and Sesnon had been replaced by Z. Wayne Griffin.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3167/2854160551_1c42836b6d_o.gif" alt="flyinghigh" height="326" width="575"><br>

The Battle of Bunker Hill would continue to be waged—that long, slow, protracted engagement, which like its previous fifteen years, would need another fifteen years before things shifted into high gear again.</p>

In the early 1900s the standard for female beauty was set by the fictional “Gibson Girl”&#157;. Created and popularized by the illustrator <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Dana_Gibson" title="Charles Dana Gibson">Charles Dana Gibson</a>, the Gibson Girl was depicted as a subtle teaser of men. <span>Â </span>She was statuesque and graceful with an impossibly tiny waist. Her long hair was styled in a sophisticated cascade of curls piled high upon her head.<span>Â  </span>It was a challenge to wear a hat on such big hair, so the clever Gibson Girls used hatpins which were more than a foot long.

		<p>It is said that the Lord protects drunks, fools, and children, and it would seem that He had his hands full keeping watch over the residents of 316 Clay Street, known variously as the Patterson Hotel and Luckenbach Estate over the years.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3231/2841546981_6bd9cc4a68.jpg" alt="fivestoryplunge" align="left" width="305" height="500">In the wee hours of August 31, 1934, one of its residents, a 31-year-old mechanic named Herbert Stockwell, decided to live out the sort of feat that is irresistible in daydreams and drunken hazes.Â  I&#8217;m speaking, of course, about stealing a car and attempting to drive it down the steps of Angel&#8217;s Flight.</p>
<p>It was a bold plan, but things soon went very ill for Herbert Stockwell.Â  Police were summoned to the scene by a loud crash, and discovered the vehicle wrecked on the steps, and Stockwell sprawled on the ground nearby.Â  His front teeth were knocked out, but he was otherwise unharmed.</p>
<p>A few years later, another resident at 316 Clay would require divine intervention as she toyed with the boundaries of human frailty.</p>
<p>Maryan Ellis was a 27-year-old waitress at a S. Hill Street cafe, and a relative newcomer to Los Angeles.Â  She was homesick, missed her mother, and was despondent that she couldn&#8217;t raise the money for a trip home to San Antonio.</p>
<p>When Ellis returned to her fifth story room at the boarding house on July 18, 1940, her roommate, Jerry Bills, decided to give Ellis a few moments of privacy.Â  Shortly after she left the room, however, she heard a scream, and returned to find that Ellis had thrown herself out the window.</p>
<p>Astonishingly, Ellis survived the fall with relatively minor injuries.Â  She fractured both heels and her pelvis, and had a few cuts and bruises, but it should have been much worse.</p>
<p>Presumably, Ellis got to see her mother after all, and hopefully, a trip back to Texas.</p>

<p>By the spring of 1968 only three of the great mansions on Bunker Hill were still standing. <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/castle">The Castle</a> (325 South Bunker Hill Ave) and Salt Box (339 South Bunker Hill Ave) were soon to be moved to their new home, Heritage Square in Highland Park (and subsequently burned down by vandals).Â  The days were definitely numbered for the Victorian beauty at 232 South Grand Avenue and smaller house behind it whose address was 232 ½.Â  The only reason the residences on Grand Avenue stood as long as they did is because the Community Redevelopment Agency (CRA) made the front house the location of their Bunker Hill Relocation Project Office. Once the residents had been removed from the neighborhood and the CRA no longer had a use for the mansion, it too was removed.</p>

</div>
<p>
The mansion at 232 South Grand Avenue and its backyard neighbor at 232 ½ were built in 1894 by Bernard Sens, a German immigrant who came to Los Angeles and set up shop as a tailor on Broadway. He had initially been residing a couple of doors down at 224 S. Grand, but apparently needed a more suitable dwelling for his wife, four sons, and six daughters. He held onto his former residence and began renting out its rooms, and presumably did the same thing with the house at 232 ½. Â </p>

</div>
<p>
Sens was a well respected tailor about town and had provided the city&#8217;s police force with their uniforms. The business was a family one, with the Sens sons contributing at one point or another. Matriarch Kate and her daughters received mention in the society pages and the Sens were a typical Bunker Hill family of the Victorian era. Bernard passes away in 1903 and his widow and their daughter Emma resided in the mansion until Kate&#8217;s death around 1923.</p>

</div>
<p>
Like most of the other neighborhood mansions, in the mid-1920s, 232 S. Grand Ave became a boarding house. Unlike many of the Victorians that were divided into numerous single room residences, the division of the former Sens home provided lodging for only four separate households. Around 1928, Dr. James Green, his wife Elizabeth, their three daughters, and two grandchildren moved in and had enough room for the doctor to also set up his practice. </p>

</div>
<p>
Dr. Green, who had been born in England and spent time in Colorado before moving west, would serve Bunker Hill residents as their physician for nearly thirty years. Dr. Green seemed to have done a fine job taking care of his patients, with the exception of sixty-five year old Theresa Dawson who, while under the doctor&#8217;s care, strangled herself with her own bandages at her home down the street. By 1939, the mansion had once again become a single family home with the Greens as its sole tenants. The doctor was paying a whopping $100 a month (around $1,200 in today&#8217;s dollars) to live in and run his business out of the ten room mansion. Dr. Green lived and worked on Bunker Hill until his death in 1956. His wife, Elizabeth, continued living on Grand until her death a few years later. </p>

</div>
<p>
Since the house was not inhabited by numerous boarders, it proved to be an ideal place for the CRA to set up its relocation headquarters in 1963. It was here that Bunker Hill residents, some of who had lived in the neighborhood for decades, received their walking papers. When the dirty work was completed in 1968, the houses at 232 and 232 ½ South Grand Avenue went the way of the rest of the grand mansions of Bunker Hill.</p>
