</div>
<p>The mansions of Bunker Hill were sometimes inhabited by colorful characters who provided the neighborhood with mayhem, madness or just plain entertainment. Others, like the Hildreth Mansion at the corner of Fourth and Hope led a peaceful, if sometimes melancholy existence, standing as the graceful pillar of a lost era until the wrecking balls came. </p>
<p>The residence that stood at 357 South Hope Street for over sixty years was built by Reverend Edward T. Hildreth, a Congregational minister and graduate of the Chicago Theological Seminary. Built in 1889 and designed by JC Newsom, the defining features of the Victorian Shingle style home were an ornate chimney and wrought iron circular balcony on the tower. Located at the northwest corner of the intersection, the exterior of the elevated house was finished off with a stone retaining wall and steps leading up the entrance.</p>
<p><img src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2351/2449717155_8f0bbd0356.jpg?v=0" alt="Hildreth Mansion" width="300"> <img src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2346/2450542716_3d06997a44.jpg?v=0" alt="Hildreth Mansion" width="300"></p>
<p>
Happiness in the Hildreth household was short lived. In 1893, the Reverend&#8217;s youngest son Richard drowned in a nearby watering hole, and his body was brought back to the family residence after it was recovered. Edward and his wife Sarah soon made plans to donate an organ to the First Congregational Church as a memorial to their son, but instead the gift came to commemorate mother and child when Sarah suddenly died in October 1895. Reverend Hildreth never completely recovered from the double loss, and the beloved minister was cared for by his daughter Faith until he passed away at the Hope Street residence in 1907. One year later, the Reverend&#8217;s young daughter/caretaker died inside the house of an undisclosed illness.</p>

</div>
<p>The mansion soon became a boarding house and stenographers, salesmen, teachers, real estate agents, carpenters, janitors, iron workers, seamstresses and many others passed through its doors. By 1939, the eighteen rooms of the house had been converted into nine residences. Boarders paid between thirteen and thirty-five dollars a month in rent and had lived in the mansion anywhere from one to twelve years. With the exception of the eighty-seven year old resident who was killed in an auto accident in 1940, the boarders of the once stately home lived a quiet existence and dried laundry on the grand wrought iron balcony.</p>
<p>By 1954, the Hildreth Mansion was but a beautiful memory, destroyed by the CRA&#8217;s visions of urban renewal.</p>

<img loading="lazy" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2093/2439669267_29311d179d_o.gif" alt="cracker" align="left" height="223" width="300">Of all the oft-pictured sites of Los Angeles, <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/angelsflight" title="FlightoftheCrockers" target="_blank">Angels Flight </a>is certainly up there amongst them, as who doesn’t go for those Oldey-Timey images?  There’s probably postcards and ceramic trivets and refrigerator magnets featuring Angels Flight from here to Toledo to Timbuktu, and people probably prefer a pre-1908, pre-Elks Club Building image of the Hill topped with the <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/node/86" title="grimgrinningghosts" target="_blank">Crocker Mansion</a> because, again, Oldey-Timey.  </p>
<p>So what of the Elks Lodge, which supplanted the Crocker (having its 100th anniversary demolition party in a few weeks), that squarish building noted more for giving the world the Angels Flight gateway than for being, well, a squarish building?<br>
<img loading="lazy" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2039/2440495858_54ea8f10ea_o.gif" alt="xmarksthespot" height="535" width="575"><br>
There were in fact two <a href="https://www.phoenixmasonry.org/masonicmuseum/fraternalism/elks.htm" title="thelks" target="_blank">BPOE</a> buildings.  The main building fronting Clay Street, at 60&#215;90&#8242;, contained an auditorium, dance hall, dormitories and offices; the Annex above at 300 South Olive, on the site of the June ’08-demolished Crocker (where District Deputy Grand Exalted Ruler John Whichner placed Elks Lodge No. 99 roster, and copies of the September 2, 1908 newspapers in the cornerstone), was 54&#215;64&#8242;, and full of reading and writing rooms, plus a billiard hall and card parlors—everything a fraternal organization needed. </p>
<p>At least for a little while.  By 1925 the Elks had built much larger and <a href="https://www.you-are-here.com/building/park_plaza.html" title="thenewlodge" target="_blank">schmantzier digs</a> over by Westlake park.  </p>
<p>300 South Olive wouldn’t go to waste, though, as the Elks’ brothers-in-fraternity, the Loyal Order of <a href="https://www.phoenixmasonry.org/masonicmuseum/fraternalism/moose.htm" title="themoose" target="_blank">Moose</a>, took over the buildings.  They covered &quot;BPOE&quot; on the aforementioned Angels Flight archway and set about putting a lot of boxers to work.  1931:<br>

And 1951:</p>

<p>No, not that <a href="https://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/carter-j.htm" title="hailtothechief" target="_blank">Jimmy Carter</a>.  </p>
<p>The Moose hung on, and kept the building til the end, despite it becoming the Royal Club:<br>

Nice quoins.</p>
<p>In September of 1962 it was just one more structure on the business end of the CRA’s bulldozers:</p>

</i><p>An old-timer on the hill, Austin Blackburn, 59, of 529 W 3rd St, said the building was a lodge meeting place when he took up residence at the now-demolished Cumberland hotel, across the street at 243 S Olive, 35 years ago.  “The Royal, and all the rest of the hill, was a wonderful place then,”&#157; he reminisced.  “They used to put on free shows and boxing matches in the theater for the folks who lived here.  Later it was a dance hall, and during World War II they made a hotel out of it.  At one time boxers used to train in a small gymnasium there.”&#157;

<p>Monday, January 14, 1963</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3005/2438460489_8dc71b93c1_o.gif" alt="jumperlong" align="left" height="896" width="200">Bunker Hill’s final days, after its Official Designation as blighted slum, evokes not only decrepit dandified buildings like the Dome, but also its downtrodden denizens, shuffling along, infused with all the despair and longing and hopelessness you’d expect from folks in a blighted slum.  It being Official, after all.  </p>
<p>Victor Palomino, 29, was one such shuffler.  He was another resident of the <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/theDome" title="anotherDomer" target="_blank">Dome</a>, who’d actually been fine and dandy until Friday last when he was canned from his gig as a carpenter at the Civic Center project.  He brooded over the wintry weekend and at mid-afternoon on a jobless Monday, thought to himself as had another of his carpenter brethren, why hast thou forsaken me? and decided to shuffle from the Dome a couple hundred feet to the northeast to the corner of First and Hope.  </p>
<p>There stood the great steel frame of the <a href="https://www.you-are-here.com/los_angeles/dwp.html" title="acmartindwp" target="_blank">Department of Water and Power building</a>.  Like King Kong, frustrated, recently out of a job, though trading Skyscraper Deco for Corporate Modern, Victor climbed fourteen stories of the skeleton and perched on a narrow I-beam 220 feet above the earth.  Would the four children of his pregnant common-law wife Angie, 21, ever see him again?  Would the seven children from his previous wife ever see him again? (Why is it residents of the Dome so like to <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/sickmanjumps" title="sickmanjumps" target="_blank">leap</a>?)</p>
<p>For three tense hours he screamed he was going to jump.  Angie and his priest screamed back (presumably for him not to, not “Jump! Jump!”&#157;) but it was Milt Borik, project manager for <a href="https://www.emporis.com/en/cd/cm/?id=gustknewbergconstructionco-chicago-il-usa" title="GKN" target="_blank">Gust K. Newberg</a>, who finally coaxed Victor down with the promise of his job back.</p>
<p>It was a ruse.  After Victor came down, he didn’t go back to his home in the Dome, with is bays and spindles, its hands at two minutes to midnight, in direct aesthetic if not moral opposition to LA&#8217;s true <a href="https://www.ladwp.com/ladwp/cms/ladwp001562.jsp" title="mulfalls" target="_blank">Mulholland Fountain</a>, no; Victor’s in Central Receiving under psych-ob, and he’ll be there for a little while.<br>

		<p>Location: 360 South Hill Street<br>
Date: September 15, 1910</p>
<p>The anonymous rooming house cyanide suicide seemed calculated to deliver himself into an unmarked pauper&#8217;s grave, but a last impulse led him to pen a letter of farewell to his mother. He did not name her, but addressed the envelope with their hometown, <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?ie=UTF8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;q=Benkelman,+NE,+USA&amp;ll=40.05311,-101.531525&amp;spn=0.028973,0.069351&amp;t=h&amp;z=14&amp;iwloc=addr" target="_blank">Benkelman, Nebraska</a>. A telegraph to the postmaster of that burg soon brought the reply: the dead man was one Judson Graves, 35, from a good family but for some time bumming broke around the west. His sorrowful mother has asked Dr. Lockwood of Pasadena to go to Pierce Brothers and claim the body, and ship it home for burial.</p>

Edna Brown, aka Edna Chaplin, aka Mabel Austin, seemed like such a nice girl. Sure, she’d been busted by Detective Sergeants Bartley and Allen for stealing $100<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'"><span>Â </span>($1,271.00 current USD)</span> from O. Johnson’s apartment at 124 South Bunker Hill Avenue, but Edna did the right thing and confessed to the crime, resulting in her being charged with grand theft and larceny.
</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
When she appeared in Judge Hinshaw’s court for her arraignment, she burst into tears and appeared to be so genuinely remorseful that Guy Eddy, an attorney who was present on another matter, came to her defense and made a motion to dismiss the case. Judge Hinshaw was also moved by the girl’s tears, and since Deputy District Attorney Orme made no objections, Edna walked.
</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
Apparently none of the well meaning men in the courtroom ever thought to question why such a seemingly nice girl would have at least two known aliases.

<p style="margin: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
A few days following Edna’s day in court, Detective Sergeants Bartley and Allen were on the trail of a girl who had been accused by J.S. Purdy of using his name to pass bad checks. Purdy told the cops he suspected a girl named Edna. When he was shown a photo of Edna Brown, he immediately identified her as the forger.Â

<img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3219/2431132295_25713dfb6b_m.jpg" alt="jamesbland" align="left" height="179" width="240"></p>
<p>Following his breakfast at the little cafe at 309 S. Flower Street, 25-year-old James D. Bland was full of bacon, eggs, and bad intentions.</p>
<p>He was not armed, but pantomimed a weapon under his coat, and threatened to shoot the waitress, Heide Ogawa, unless she emptied the register.  Bland also herded three other cafe employees into a back storage room.</p>
<p>Ogawa handed over the restaurant&#8217;s $18 take, and then, for reasons known perhaps only to himself, Bland decided to free the other employees before making his departure.</p>
<p>There are two versions of what happened next, but both make for pretty good stories.</p>
<p>According to police, a Negro dishwasher named Arthur Sanders bashed Bland over the head with the handle of a meat cleaver when he was on his way out the door.  Then, while Bland was unconscious, the cafe employees tied him up with cords from a laundry bag, and waited for help.</p>
<p>However, at his court date, it was reported that after Bland released the other employees, Ogawa saw her chance and gave him a good shove.  Bland lost his balance and stumbled into the arms of a cook, who shoved him in a laundry bag and tied it shut.</p>
<p>Bland entered a guilty plea to second degree robbery and was sentenced to 5 years probation and 1 year in County Jail.</p>

<p>Old Bunker Hill can evoke images of Victorian grander and prosperity, as well as faded glory and great loss. While many associate the history of Bunker Hill with the buildings that once decorated the landscape, the riches to rags stories of the neighborhood also belong to many of its inhabitants. The Rose Mansion at Fourth Street and Grand Avenue was once one of the most picturesque homes on the Hill and its builder and namesake a highly regarded pioneer of Los Angeles County.  Despite a celebrated beginning, the house would be demolished long before the Community Redevelopment Agency (CRA) razed the neighborhood, and its original owner would meet his end in a most macabre manner.</p>
<div style="text-align: center">
</div>
<p>Leonard John Rose (L.J.), was a native of Bavaria who immigrated to New Orleans when he was twelve. He received  an education in Illinois and engaged in early business ventures in Iowa before organizing a party, including his wife Amanda and two children, to travel to California in 1857. After crossing the Colorado River, the group was attacked by a Native American tribe, incurring losses of life and supplies. Rose and his family survived and temporarily settled in New Mexico. The family made it to California in 1860 and established themselves in the San Gabriel Valley.</p>

</div>
<div style="text-align: center">
<i>Sunny Slope Ranch</i> 
</div>
<p>Sunny Slope was the name of the renowned ranch Rose acquired shortly after arriving in Southern California. Located in what is now the eastern end of Pasadena, the 1,900 acre property contained countess lemon, orange and olive trees, but became famous for its vineyards.  Vines were imported from Spain, Italy and Peru, and the wine and brandy generated from Sunny Slope made L.J. Rose a household name and a very wealthy man. He also found success as a breeder with a horse ranch named Rosemead (where the city of the same name now stands), and eventually became a State Senator.</p>
<div align="center">

</div>
<p>In 1887, the somewhat secluded neighborhood of Bunker Hill attracted Rose, and he purchased land at the corner of Fourth and Grand (then called Charity) to build a palatial home for his family that now included nine children. Construction on the house was such a massive undertaking that a scathing editorial appeared in the Los Angeles Times criticizing the builders for piling up so much lumber in the streets that carriages could not pass through.</p>
<p>Designed by architects Curlett &amp; Eissen at a cost of around $50,000 and completed in 1888, the Rose Mansion was a gleaming gem among the jewels of Bunker Hill. The L.A. Times ran a piece dedicated solely to the stained glass widows, designed by Rose&#8217;s son <a href="https://www.guyrose.com/" title="Guy Rose Art" target="_blank">Guy</a>, who would become a respected Impressionist painter. The Los Angeles Evening Express was so impressed with the stately structure that an extensive article appeared in 1890 describing the interior whose “first and second floors are finished in hard woods and the third in white cedar.”&#157; The dining room had a “heavily paneled ceiling”&#157; and a bay window with an “elaborately carved arch of oak supported by dragons.”&#157; A “heavily carved giant staircase”&#157; ran through the house and frescoes by [Attilio] Moretti of San Francisco adorned the ceilings. The home also included a plush library and music room, but the most talked about part of the house was the wine cellar where Rose stored an impressive selection of wines and spirits. On the outside, the most distinct feature of the property was the granite retaining wall surrounding the house with polished steps leading up to the entry.</p>
<div align="center">

</div>
<p>Despite his tremendous success, by 1899 bad investments had left Rose deeply in debt with properties so heavily mortgaged that selling them would have been fruitless. On May 17, a despondent Rose told his wife he was going to Ventura on business and would be returning the next day. Instead, he returned to Los Angeles that night and drafted a suicide note addressed to the his wife at the Mansion, and mailed it. At 10 o&#8217;clock the next morning, Mrs. Rose received the letter with Rose stating financial ruin as the reason for taking his own life. He continued the letter by bidding an affectionate farewell to his family.</p>
<p>Also included was a postscript stating that his body could be found in the backyard of the Mansion.</p>
<p>Family present at the time “were too overwhelmed with apprehension to go to the yard to see whether his dead body was really there.”&#157; Mrs. Rose&#8217;s son-in-law was summoned from his office Downtown and upon arrival found “his father-in-law lying face downward in a little hollow at the rear of the lot. His head reclined on his hat, and in one hand was clasped a bunch of carnations.”&#157; Miraculously, Rose was still alive and was taken to a hospital where his stomach was pumped to remove the 65 morphine pills he had swallowed. Despite the efforts to save his life, too much of the drug had been absorbed into his system and Leonard John Rose died at the age of 72. The official cause of death was morphine poisoning.</p>

<p>
L.J. Rose was heavily eulogized by the county he had called home for nearly 40 years and the “courageous pioneer”&#157; was laid to rest in Evergreen Cemetery. In the meantime, his wife Amanda was left with a ruined empire and the Mansion was soon lost to foreclosure. After a mere 11 years, the Roses no longer reigned over the house at Fourth and Grand.</p>

<i>Rose Mansion (lower right side)</i>
</div>
<p>The Rose Mansion was briefly occupied by real estate investor Albert W. McCready. In 1903 the residence was purchased by Colonel Albert B. Hotchkiss, creator and editor of the local publication Public Economy, with his wife Mary. <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=%22hotchkiss+park%22&amp;near=Santa+Monica,+CA&amp;fb=1&amp;cid=34006532,-118484103,11423716760271147898&amp;li=lmd&amp;z=14&amp;t=m" title="Hotchkiss Park" target="_blank">Mrs. Hotchkiss</a> , one of the few women in early Los Angeles to make a name for herself in real estate. A colorful character, Mary Hotchkiss at one time owned a large chunk of Main Street and was once accused of abducting a neighbor&#8217;s parrot named “Dude.”&#157; Colonel Hotchkiss  died of natural causes inside the mansion and Mary wasted no time in landing husband #3, Dr. J.T. Jauch.</p>

</div>
<p>The Jauches resided at the former Rose Mansion until 1928, when they took up permanent residence at the Fremont Hotel on Fourth and Olive, which Mary owned. The building appears to have remained vacant and in 1935 the State Emergency Relief Administration (SERA) proposed using the residence to house transients. The Health Commission turned this idea down.</p>

</div>
<p>By 1937 the Rose Mansion was supposedly in such disrepair that it was no longer inhabitable. In the biography L.J. Rose of Sunny Slope, the pioneer&#8217;s son claims that the heavy wood paneling was salvaged by 20th Century Fox and used to decorate sets on the Alice Faye/Tyrone Power feature In Old Chicago. When the CRA began its invasion of Bunker Hill in the 1950s, all that remained was the garage and the ghosts of the Rose Mansion and its owners.</p>

February 26, 1889Â 
</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
When thirteen year old Lizzie Fryer failed to return to her home on <street w:st="on"><address w:st="on">Bunker Hill Avenue</address></street> for supper, her parents began to fret. As the evening wore on, they became so concerned that they decided to search for her.Â 
</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
At first they thought that Lizzie might be in the company of a young man named Zens. Lizzie was a popular girl, tall and well developed for her age, and she had been allowed to go to parties with Zens because he was related by marriage to a good friend of theirs, Mr. Clearwater. Because of the congenial relationship between the two families, the Fryers had always felt comfortable allowing Lizzie to spend much of her free time with the Clearwaters.
</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
The Fryers were confident that they’d find Lizzie at the <city w:st="on">Clearwater</city> home in <place w:st="on">East Los Angeles</place>. <span>Â </span>However, upon their arrival they were given some very disturbing news. Mrs. Clearwater said that she had not seen Lizzie – and coincidentally, her husband, father of their several young children, was also missing!
</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
Suddenly Lizzie’s mother remembered a strange conversation that she’d had with her daughter just a few days earlier. “What would you do if I left home and never returned?”&#157;, Lizzie had asked. <span>Â </span>Believing that Lizzie was only joking, she hadn’t paid much attention to such fanciful speculation. However, in retrospect she found their conversation alarming, particularly since <city w:st="on"><place w:st="on">Clearwater</place></city> and Lizzie had always seemed to be extremely fond of each other.Â 
</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
The frantic parents continued to search for their missing daughter, but things took a turn for the worse when they spoke with local shopkeepers and learned that Lizzie had been seen with <city w:st="on"><place w:st="on">Clearwater</place></city> at about noon. According to witnesses, the couple had been headed toward the Southern Pacific Depot. <span>Â </span>When the Frys discovered that a northbound train departed after 1 pm, it was enough to convince them that Lizzie and <city w:st="on"><place w:st="on">Clearwater</place></city> were on the run together and headed north.<span>Â  </span>They immediately went to the police station and asked Chief Cooney to send a wire asking that the train be searched when it reached <city w:st="on"><place w:st="on">Tulare</place></city>. The wire was sent, and the train was scoured for the missing couple, but they were nowhere to be found. The distraught Fryer’s swore out a complaint against their former friend.Â 
</p>

If the runaway girl and her married lover were ever found, it wasn’t reported in the LA Times.</p>

Martin Weiss, who runs the Chicago Saloon on Court Street, was arrested for permitting gambling in his establishment.
</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;

<p style="margin: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
Martin wasn’t worried – he was convinced that with his charm and wit he would completely annihilate the case against him. When he took the witness stand, Weiss swore a solemn oath that the boys who had been accused of gambling in his saloon had never done any such thing. Imagine Martin’s surprise when he was found guilty.

Imagine everyone else’s surprise, when no sooner had sentence been pronounced than Weiss swore again. This time it wasn’t an oath to tell the whole truth and nothing but – instead he swore out a complaint against the boys who patronized his saloon – for gambling with dice for money! <span>Â </span>
