The Belmont was a behemoth at the base of Bunker Hill, its situation on the southern center beckoned folk who–were we to paint in purely lurid hue–simply sought a thieves den, or that final refuge before the big self-snuff.   Was there more to this big, beautiful building?  Why, naturally.</p>
<p>It all began with the YWCA, an organization that sought to harbor white Christian women from the williwaws of urban iniquity.  And where better to do so than that hillock of high-mindedness, Bunker Hill?</p>
<p>A colony of civic-minded women formed the LA-YWCA in 1893 in two rooms at 212 S. Broadway, then moved into the Schumacher Building at 107 S. Spring in 1894.  They then shuttled off into the shelter of the old City Hall at 211 W. Second, and finally took over a whole floor of the Conservative Life building at the NE corner of Third and Hill in ”&#x2122;06.  They were renting out a small building as their annex, on the same side of Hill, forty feet north of Third, and decided <i>enough of this penny-ante gynoprotection</i>, we”&#x2122;re purchasing that  property and erecting an sky-scraping HQ.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3040/2832545712_3718271e62_o.gif" alt="Higher" height="600" width="376"></p>

<p>They dropped cornerstone in 1907 and moved in aught-eight.  Its basement held an auditorium for 500, a gymnasium, and a 30&#215;50”&#x2122; swimming pool.  It was most noted for its gargantuan light well, which formed an open-air patio famous for its flower boxes filled with color-coordinated flora cascading to a fancy tile floor.</p>

<p>4,000 women, including 1,600 students engaged in the study of the domestic sciences, swam and ate and sewed and so on and all was fine and good until 1919, when the Y gals sold the building, deciding “to be nearer the shopping.”&#157;</p>
<p>(In 1926 they opened their grand Y-hotel at 939 S. Figueroa, moving their offices into this building on the right [now the site of the <a href="http://www.figueroahotel.com/pages/about.html" title="hotelfig" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hotel Figueroa</a>”&#x2122;s pool].) </p>

<p>251 South Hill was purchased by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_League" title="damnyankees" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Union League</a> Club of Los Angeles, where the Republican Women”&#x2122;s Club (the incipient <a href="http://www.cfrw.org/" title="CFRW" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CFRW</a>). often met.</p>
<p>The Union League held on to 251 until 1924; its conversion into the Hotel Belmont begins in April of that year.  Alexander Mayer spends $400,000 ($4,812,791 USD2007) in the remodel–remaking 200 rooms, all with shower and bath, all with hand-painted furniture.<br>

One of the Belmont”&#x2122;s most notorious residents was Santa Claus.  Motley Flint, Los Angeles Postmaster and Illustrious Potentate of the city”&#x2122;s <a href="http://almalaikah.com/" title="mystic!" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Al Malaikah</a> Temple (our local Shriners, AAONMS),  arranged with postal authorities to have all letters addressed to Santa (which theretofore had gone to the dead-letter office) sent to the Belmont Hotel, as that was where the Shrine set up their annual Christmas relief drive.  The basement would fill with donated toys, clothing and fruit cakes; everyone could come and receive yuletide relief at the Belmont.  And the Shriners special Santa squad found each and every letter-penning tot and saw to it that the hoped-for toy made it from the Belmont basement into their needy hands.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3253/2832546658_6b3c71f729_o.gif" alt="aloofmaloof" align="left" height="129" width="194"><br>
Another fun member of the Belmont clan was Walter Maloof, 55, a familiar sight among the Downtown shuffling class, a gent who spent his days peddling watches and other odd articles on street-corners.  Apparently there”&#x2122;s good money in the odd article, as after he died in his Belmont hotel room in February 1963, his bankbook showed he had some $19,000 ($127,399 USD2007) squirreled away.</p>
<p>Of course, the Belmont also harbored the likes of Achilles N. Bororas, 41, whose not only knocked over markets and service stations up and down California in 1954, but robbed churches and nabbed narcotics from drugstores.<br>
<i></i></p>
<p><i>You don”&#x2122;t mess with the Belmont</i> when it comes to <i>committing</i> crimes.  James Rader, 28, led a gang of hotel robbers.  His accomplices were Gordon Edwards, 18; Frank Darrow, 22; Miss Margie Petrie, 18; and a sixteen year-old girl.  They”&#x2122;d knocked over fifteen downtown hotels when they thought they”&#x2122;d take on the Belmont, March 9, 1957.  The gang were in mid-rob when Edwards was clobbered by 71 year-old Belmont <img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3005/2831709917_803d968909_o.gif" alt="dontmesswthebelmont" align="right" height="87" width="321">elevator operator William Patterson, who struck Edwards with his stool (that is, the small stool he sat on in his elevator) and knocked the knife from his hand.  Rader struck Patterson with the butt of his gun; the robbers then tangled with 65 year-old Belmont desk clerk A. B. Cramer and eventually fled the scene empty handed–even more so than they came in with, as one of the crew lost their wallet, and they were all easily traced to a downtown roominghouse and arrested.</p>
<p>And there are always those who seek permanent solutions to temporary problems.  They, as such, instead of waiting for God to fire them, will raise their fists to the heavens and yell “I quit!”&#157;<br>

On March 29, 1936, employees of the Belmont were alarmed that Jeanette Stevenson, 45, wouldn”&#x2122;t answer her telephone.  The note she left described domestic difficulties; she”&#x2122;d decided a bottle of poison was the antidote to that particular issue.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3008/2831709555_21094f8be7_o.gif" alt="foiledagain" align="left" height="227" width="263">In January 1938, Mrs. Veronica De Shon Miller, 47, recently of Kansas City, divorced, despondent over the death of a friend, and an out-of-work beautician to boot, soaked a towel in ether and smothered herself in her Belmont flat.  She was saved there by a friend.  Fearing that the Belmont was conspiring to keep her alive, she left a note regarding the disposition of her belongings and made her way to the building at Fourth and Broadway where she once operated a beauty parlor, and flung herself to the concrete floor at the bottom of the light well.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3269/2832546746_62b7ac8c9e_o.gif" alt="leapingdentists" align="right" height="123" width="234">September 28, 1942.  Dr. Robert E. Hunsaker, 45, was due in court to face a hearing in a suit filed by his third wife for divorce.  So he got a room at the Belmont.  Top floor.  Desk clerk Bernardo Sargil noticed Hunsaker on the window ledge and called the cops; when they got there they found dancer Ruth Rex in his room, pleading with him not to jump.  The cops tried to grab him but Hunsaker ordered them back; finally he said “So long boys, this is getting tiresome,”&#157; and loosened his grip, falling the length of the building to meet Hill Street below.</p>

<p>November 1, 1942.  Anne Kennedy, 18, was despondent over ill health, or so letters left in her Belmont hotel room indicated.  Nevertheless she was still gaily dressed in her black-and-yellow Halloween party costume when she leapt, or fell, from her sixth-floor window at the back of the hotel.</p>
<p>Third and Hill, 1906, pre-YWCA:  Angels Flight “inclined cable tramway”&#157; at far left; the St. Helena Sanitarium (perhaps you”&#x2122;ve noticed the “Vegeterian Café”&#157; signage in images of Angels Flight?–that”&#x2122;s these folk); and some residential structures at 251 and beyond (including one labeled “old &amp; vacant”&#157;).  The shingled structure in the vintage image above (that”&#x2122;s a “Berlin Dry Cleaning”&#157; truck in front), seen below as 247, was the Kensington.   Above, the Astoria.  <br>

<p>The Belmont is leased to hotel chain operators Porter and Knapp in 1941, who sink scads of dough in her, reopening the pool, enlarging and refurbishing the roof garden, refurnishing and redecorating the rooms. But all that money couldn”&#x2122;t stem the decline of the neighborhood.<br>

Two codgers stroll Hill in the early 60s; they”&#x2122;ll cadge together enough for a fifth and head to Pershing Square to argue Bay of Pigs for the afternoon.  Then it”&#x2122;s back to the Belmont for a nap.</p>

The sixth-floor room of John Riles, 69, believed to have been smoking in bed, went up in flames, engulfing a good bit of that floor and part of the seventh, and all of the late John Riles.  <br>

What fire couldn”&#x2122;t do to the Belmont, the CRA could; the summer of 1971 saw the Bunker Hill Redevelopment Project at the tail-end of its demolitions and the YWCA/Union League/Belmont, one of the last standing Stalwarts, tumbled under wreckers”&#x2122; hammers.</p>

		<p>Location: 220 South Grand Avenue<br>
Date: June 18, 1929</p>
<p>It is a thirsty Bunker Hill that laments the arrest of the bright and brainy Shirley Winters, 23-year-old resident of 220 South Grand, on suspicion of conspiracy to violate the Volstead Act. </p>
<p>Shirley was popped in a South Hill Street hotel room after Georgia Street vice squad Detective Lieutenants Shoemaker and Kearner overheard her take two telephone orders, one for two and another for three quarts of hooch. (In case you&#8217;re wondering, it&#8217;s $3.50 each for two quarts, and just $3 more for lucky number three.) </p>
<p>Shirley was paid $50 a week, and not just for her lilting telephone voice–her specialty was keeping the day&#8217;s orders (including delivery addresses!) in her head until she could convey them to the bottling plant on West Seventh Street. She would have gotten away with it, too, but her boss got popped and spilled everything, and the cops have been picking off the little fish for weeks. Today they caught a live one, the gal with the million dollar hippocampus. She pled not guilty, and in November was sentenced along with other small fry in the gang to  eleven months (suspended).</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Location: 240 South Olive Street<br>
Date: December 2, 1903</p>
<p>After the dust cleared on the foggy tracks of the Pacific Electric Railway and the smashed Long Beach car was extricated from its unwelcome union with the Whittier car, Motorman F.A. Brewster was asked why the heck he&#8217;d stopped dead and allowed his machine to be smashed. The cause, it transpired, was a deranged old resident of the address above, Mrs. Lucinda Andrews, who had bolted from her relatives&#8217; home &quot;while suffering a temporary aberration&quot; and wandered aimlessly through the night before presenting herself &quot;staggering about unsteadily&quot; immediately ahead of the oncoming Long Beach car. Brewster set his air brakes and reversed, but fearing the woman had been struck, stopped and ran back with Conductor A.L. Healgon to see if they could help her. Lucinda was hiding in a nearby field and refused to come when called. Returning to their car, Brewster and Healgon heard the Whittier train approaching and went to start their own, only to hear the crackle of the &quot;overhead&quot; burning out. The Long Beach car was a doorstop, and the Whittier car came on inexorably. Attempts to flag it down failed due to the fog, and the crash followed. Lucinda ended up in distant Dozier a couple days later, where she caught a ride home with Conductor F.M. Bickenstein. When questioned by police she professed complete ignorance of the past days events&#8230; though when pressed, confessed the spectacle of the train crash had lingered with her. A call went out to Olive Street, and her relatives came and took the old gal home. </p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>George Roughton&#8217;s boarding house at 324 Clay Street was advertised as possessing a &quot;most healthful locality&quot; and &quot;very fine view.&quot;  However, it&#8217;s unlikely that it appeared that way to tenants who were awakened at dawn on July 2, 1894 to find the place engulfed in flames.</p>
<p>The fire was caused by an oil stove explosion in the basement rooms of &quot;a colored family named Phoenix,&quot; and destroyed the entire building within minutes.  Roughton was only partially insured for the loss, which was estimated at between $3000-$4000 ($76,000-$102,000 2008 USD), and most tenants lost all of their possessions.</p>
<p>After making their escape, the residents of 324 Clay did a head count, and discovered one among their number to be missing.  Otto Liebman was recalled by his neighbors as elderly and a semi-invalid who had lived on the third floor for only a few months.</p>
<p>When Liebman failed to turn up, and his remains could not be found in the ashes, a concerned neighbor reported his disappearance&#8230; two weeks after the fire.  Within a day or so, however, the mystery was solved.</p>
<p>In perhaps the greatest understatement ever to find its way into print, the <i>Times</i> reported, &quot;Otto Liebman is alive and well instead of being burned to death.&quot;  It turns out that on the morning of the fire, Liebman woke up choking from smoke inhalation, and crawled down the stairs to safety.  As soon as he reached the street, he passed out until he was discovered by a friend, who carried him home.  Liebman remained in bed for a week, recovering from the shock.  After his recovery, the friend did him a solid and found the penniless and now homeless man work in a fruit and tobacco shop.</p>
<p>But as for the good neighbors at 324 Clay, not only did they fail to report his disappearance for two weeks, they also gave police an entirely inaccurate description, Liebman being neither elderly nor gray-headed as they&#8217;d reported.</p>

<p>The house that stood at 221 South Olive may not have been as ornate as some of its Bunker Hill neighbors, but unlike the homes of <a href="/crocker_mansion">Margaret Crocker</a> and <a href="/rose_mansion">L.J. Rose</a>, the residence on Olive survived from the earliest days of the neighborhood until the bitter end. Set back from the street, up two small sets of stairs, and surrounded by foliage, the fading Victorian beauty was a popular subject of the photographers who documented the Hill in its waning years.</p>
<div style="text-align: center">

</div>
<p>The mansion was built in 1887 by Herman F. Baer, a real estate developer who was responsible for a number of residences in the area. The original address of the Baer home was 117 South Olive, but soon became 221 South Olive due to further development of the area and an 1889 ordinance renumbering street addresses. When the property was surveyed prior to its demolition, the American Institute of Architects noted that the house bore a striking resemblance to the design style of local architects Samuel and Joseph C. Newson.</p>
<div style="text-align: center">

</div>
<p>By 1891, Baer was out and the Doran family was in. John J. Doran operated a stationary shop on Main Street which also provided the city with school supplies, fine pictures, candles, vegetable &amp; olive oil, magazines and a well assorted stock of Catholic books. Doran passed away in 1892, but his widow Mary, their son, and three daughters continued to live on Olive and threw parties worthy of the society pages. The Dorans left Olive Street around 1905, selling the property to R.A. Fowler who unloaded it a couple of years later for $26,500 (over half a million in today&#8217;s dollars). By this time, the residence had been converted into a boarding house.</p>

<p>Compare to many boarding houses in the neighborhood, the Baer/Doran house witnessed very little excitement. In 1926, resident Albert V. Herndon bought a train ticket to Kansas to visit his ailing father and was never heard from again. On a less morbid note, boarder Thorsten Anderson left his Olive Street room in 1930 on Labor Day to go to the Plaza for a pro-Communist demonstration. He and seventeen other participants spent the night in the slammer when they were arrested for disturbing the peace. In keeping with the public disturbance theme, resident James C McLean was hauled out of  his room and arrested in December 1934. At that time, the City was in the midst of a transportation strike and McLean was accused of setting a streetcar at Third and Bixel on fire. Though he denied being responsible for the incident, the burns on his hands made the police think otherwise. </p>
<div style="text-align: center">

</div>
<p>
While the neighborhood continued its downward decline, the house on Olive street maintained its peaceful existence. By 1939, the house had been divided up into fourteen different residences. According to the WPA household census, boarders paid from six to twenty dollars a month in rent and had lived in the house for a month up to sixteen years. Unlike many of the Victorian mansions getting on in their years, the Olive house was in decent condition, only requiring minor repairs.</p>

</div>
<p>
The picturesque mansion house survived without incident into the mid-1960s. In 1964, the Community Redevelopment Agency purchased the property from owner Louis Swiatel in order to demolish it. After fifty seven years, the house at 221 South Olive Street was no more. </p>

Over the <a href="http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=pphhphoto&amp;fileName=ca/ca0200/ca0250/photos/browse.db&amp;action=browse&amp;recNum=0&amp;title2=Richfield%20Oil%20Building,%20555%20South%20Flower%20Street,%20Los%20Angeles,%20Los%20Angeles%20County,%20CA&amp;displayType=1&amp;itemLink=h?pp/hh:@field(NUMBER+@band(ca0250))" title="Richfield" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Richfield Building</a> now, we”&#x2122;re going to swoop down between the rooftops of the <a href="http://bigorangelandmarks.blogspot.com/2007/07/no-43-california-club-building.html" title="CCmusicfactory" target="_blank" rel="noopener">California Club</a> and the <a href="http://jpg3.lapl.org/pics13/00026185.jpg" title="ChurchoftheDemolishedDoor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bible Institute</a>, across the top of <a href="http://bigorangelandmarks.blogspot.com/2007/07/no-46-central-library-building.html" title="CentLib" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Central Library</a>, soaring toward the <a href="http://www.publicartinla.com/Downtown/figueroa/bunker_hill/1_bunker_hill.html" title="Edison" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Edison</a> and <a href="http://jpg2.lapl.org/pics19/00019043.jpg" title="SunkistBldng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the</a> Sunkist <a href="http://blogdowntown.com/2006/11/2415-history-lesson-downtowns-sunkist-building" title="SunKissed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Building&#8230;</a><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3020/2813336218_2d0706e979_o.gif" alt="flyingin" height="431" width="575"></p>
<p>(&#8230;ignore those strange giant floating numbers and letters, by the way; be advised they are as harmless as they are, for our purposes, useless.)</p>
<p>And now with a great dip we zip toward the corner of Fifth and Grand–eagle of eye will note that behind the <a href="http://jpg3.lapl.org/pics14/00026778.jpg" title="Since1911" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Engstrum</a> on Hope Street stands the <a href="/node/137" title="Tourained" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Touraine </a> and the rooftop of the Zahn”&#x2122;s <a href="/node/133" title="Zahn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wickland Apartments</a>  ”¦beyond that one can just make out the turreted <a href="/node/106" title="Hildreth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hildreth Mansion</a>.

<p>
Blast off into the sky!  We shoot up and over to the west, then point ourselves east to view Bunker Hill of the soul”¦devoid of light and life”¦the great red beast that appears ready to burst is the <a href="/TheElmar" title="Elmar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elmar</a>”¦the center slender building jutting from the Elmar is the <a href="/vanfleet" title="VanFleetofFoot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Van Fleet</a> .  Note the dusty stretch of dirt to the north of the Elmar, where invisible children cavort–may someday there they plop a <a href="/node/157" title="BHplayground" target="_blank" rel="noopener">playground</a>!  (And see how Bunker Hill looms over the <a href="http://jpg2.lapl.org/pics19/00019096.jpg" title="civiccenter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">likes of</a> the California State Building, the Hall of Records, the Hall of Justice!) </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aha”¦down there”¦with the Clift Hotel on our left, the Stanley above the Second Street tunnel, that means that red T-shape is the Winton”¦shall we dare shoot down past its backside”¦? <br>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us retreat up Flower toward First, make a hard right just past, why, the s(t)olid rectangular yellowish edifice at the corner, if it isn”&#x2122;t the <a href="/MoreRossmere" title="Rossmere" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rossmere</a> in all its rectitude. <br>

<p>
And wethinks we espy the Melrose beyond?  Let”&#x2122;s glide down over Hope and have a look-see!  That”&#x2122;s the <a href="/burnmelroseburn" title="Melroseplace" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Melrose</a> all right, across Bunker Hill Avenue, sitting on the other side of Grand between First and Second. <br>

<p>
Now we”&#x2122;re aeronauting down Grand, looking across the intersection of Second”¦there”&#x2122;s the <a href="/DomeWrapUp" title="DomeLight" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dome</a> on the corner”¦<br>

Raising the spyglass to your eye, you”&#x2122;ll see that at one o”&#x2122;clock above the Dome sits–with the green roof–the <a href="/node/117" title="brousseau" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brousseau</a>.

<p>
Sailing over the Melrose now!  To its west, of course, the <a href="/richelieu" title="Richelieu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Richelieu</a>.   The yellow building behind is the <a href="/node/174" title="Argyle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Argyle</a>. <br>

<p>
Let”&#x2122;s fly up and swing wide–turn back to see <a href="/TheDirtPatchofSecondandHill" title="DP" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hill and Olive</a> across First and Second”¦the <a href="/TheMooreCliff" title="MC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moore Cliff</a> and <a href="/HillStBlockRoundup" title="EM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">El Moro</a> perched on their Hill  Street bluff.

<p>
Coasting out even further now, on the other side of Broadway, from here the raw maw of the Second Street tunnel looks like a tiny gasp”¦over which the <a href="/hotelnorthern" title="onlyaNorthernhotel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Northern</a> holds dominion.<br>

<p>Venturing in closer now&#8230;that squat red building hiding behind the eerily-white seven-story Glove Cigar Mfg. Bldg. at 319 S. Hill is the Hotel <a href="/claycentral" title="LCC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lorraine/Clayton/Central</a>.  L/C/C&#8217;s blocky red brethren over its left shoulder are the <a href="/elksannex" title="elksnannex" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elks Lodge and Annex</a>.  <br>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now let”&#x2122;s aviate our way ever closer”¦closer”¦just a stone&#8217;s throw from <a href="/angelsflight" title="topofAF" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Angels Flight</a>&#8230;til we hover near the <a href="/theAstoria" title="notqueens" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Astoria </a>.

Granted, the streets may be deserted. But may we not still run afoul of Robert Nixon? He only went to the chair a few months ago. This is quite obviously a haunted place. We must turn tail and soar away with great urgency and return to our world”¦bid farewell”¦</p>

<p>What have you just seen?  A model of Los Angeles, built by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Works_Progress_Administration" title="WPA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WPA </a> from 1938-40, for the purposes of city planning (via which they evidently deduced “it all goes!”&#157;)”¦on a related note, this model was once many, many times larger.  The County (whose infinite wisdom never ceases to inspire) dumpster”&#x2122;d the majority of it in the 70s.  </p>
<p>Nevertheless, your trip today showed you only a smidgen of Bunker Hill, and a fraction of the model.  I guarantee that in the flesh–it, yours–you”&#x2122;ll stand gape-mouthed for an eternity staring deep into LA”&#x2122;s prewar theatre and financial and industrial districts.</p>
<p>Plus down at the museum they”&#x2122;ve endless tonnage of interesting old LA, e.g. the <a href="http://jpg1.lapl.org/pics46/00042921.jpg" title="clockface" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clock-face</a> from the <a href="http://jpg2.lapl.org/pics17/00018434.jpg" title="CC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">County Courthouse</a>.  (And in the same room as the WPA model there”&#x2122;s an ancient oil well beam pumping unit with a counter-balance one”&#x2122;d fill with river rocks–worth the price of admission right there. [Does <i>this</i> fan of <a href="http://jpg1.lapl.org/pics48/00043641.jpg" title="Brea1908" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vintage petroleum exploration</a> a world of good, anyway.])</p>
<p>So <a href="http://www.nhm.org/information/directions.htm" title="going" target="_blank" rel="noopener">go</a> <a href="http://www.nhm.org/" title="there" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there </a> <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=900+exposition+blvd,+los+angeles,+ca&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=66.281516,113.203125&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=34.018572,-118.290138&amp;spn=0.008661,0.013819&amp;t=h&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr" title="map" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now</a>.  The model and the rest of the LA stuff in the basement, in the <a href="http://www.nhm.org/research/anthropology/Pages/Exhibits.htm#LHCH" title="calhistroom" target="_blank" rel="noopener">California History room</a>. </p>
<p>And yes, Timmy and Susie, there”&#x2122;s also lots of dinosaur bones and stuffed lions.  And <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWu13GyNSbg" title="ImtheFifthBugaloo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bugaloo specimens</a> in the insect gallery.<br></p>

<p>In January 1924, inventor Raymond Ragsdell of 202 South Grand wrote a letter to the Los Angeles Traffic Commission about his idea for a collapsible car that would fold down to the size of a go-cart.  &quot;With an automobile of this type it will be possible to park millions of cars where we are now able to park but a few hundred.&quot;</p>
<p>At around the same time, Eugene Egbert Dobbs of 303 South Hope Street wrote a letter of his own, proposing that all automobiles and street cars be barred from the downtown area (he laid out Sunset, Pico, Los Angeles, and Figueroa as the perimeter).  In the letter he stated, &quot;The only objection to this plan would come from those who are too lazy to walk.  Now, our modern race is unhealthy due to lack of exercise. This barring of all transportation in the downtown district would force Los Angeles people to exercise, whether they wanted to or not, and thus, increase the length of life of the average citizen.&quot;</p>
<p>Sure, Bunker Hill residents may have had a vested interest in the issue, but in fact, the Traffic Commission received hundreds of ideas for congestion relief that month from people all over the city.  Were they an invested citizenry?  Untapped urban planners?  The ancestors of the City Council that would ban fast food franchises in South Los Angeles over 80 years later?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, they thought they were entering a contest.</p>
<p>An ad had appeared in local publications erroneously stating that the Traffic Commission would give a prize of $10,000 ($128,633 2008 USD) to the person who could solve Los Angeles&#8217;s burgeoning traffic problem.  There was apparently some confusion, as the $10,000 in question had actually been appropriated by City Council for the formation of a Traffic Commission committee to look into issues of street parking and congestion.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles Traffic Commission was formed in 1922 in response to concerns about the city&#8217;s increasingly snarled and woefully inadequate roads.  The group&#8217;s chairman said, &quot;It is time for Los Angeles to solve her traffic problem&#8230; One can but guess at the conditions which will exist here within a few years unless relief is forthcoming.&quot;</p>
<p>Preliminary solutions to the problem were eerily similar to today&#8217;s:  restricting parking in congested areas, requiring vehicles for hire to operate from private property, more one-way streets, and a subway system.</p>
<p>Following a report that traffic congestion on many Los Angeles streets was worse than New York City&#8217;s, a traffic relief ordinance was placed on the 1924 November ballot, allocating $5 million for the implementation of numerous streets projects and congestion relief programs, including the extensions of Figueroa and Olive from Bunker Hill into Elysian Park.  It passed, but Mayor George Cryer vetoed it, and I promise, you will never guess why.</p>
<p>Actually, Cryer liked the ordinance a whole lot and thought it would be good for the city, but he vetoed it because he said <i>it didn&#8217;t provide enough protections and accommodations for pedestrians</i>.</p>
<p>Within a year, a new traffic plan was underway, and the city grid began to look a great deal more like it does today, but it does my Metro-riding heart good to know that even in 1924, someone was looking out for the walking man.</p>

<p>When we last discussed the Fremont Hotel, we took a look at the antics of some of the hotel&#8217;s residents over it&#8217;s five decade existence. This time around, the Fremont employees get to bask in the OnBunkerHill spotlight.<br id="f:cy"></p>
<div style="text-align: center">

<p><br id="f:cy0"><br>
First up is Harry Stewart, the Fremont bellboy who was arrested on grand larceny charges in 1903. Apparently Mr. Stewart supplemented his income by stealing valuables from the rooms of hotel guests. The jig was up when a valuable diamond pin was removed from the room of Owl Drug president D.W. Kirkland (<a href="/node/183">who would live out his days at the hotel</a>). While the jewel was not recovered from the bellboy&#8217;s living quarters, some other items were discovered, including a sock. For some reason, Stewart had also lifted the sock from Kirkland&#8217;s room and left behind its mate. The footwear was enough to implicate him in the crime and he served the next six months in jail. Upon release, the former Fremont bellboy just couldn&#8217;t give up his wicked, wicked ways and was immediately arrested again for stealing five bucks out of a purse.<br id="f:cy2"></p>
<p>Next is S.J. Messing, a clerk at the Fremont Hotel who was arrested in 1910 for embezzlement. It seems that Messing had had a business partnership in San Francisco the previous year and his partner, Frank Smith, felt he had been embezzled out of a whole $25. Mr. Smith felt so wronged by his former partner that he repeatedly had Messing arrested, hoping the charge would stick. The first arrest came when Messing was recovering from malaria in a Napa hospital and the second arrest occurred while he was enjoying a show at the Orpheum. The final time came when Messing was in his bed at the Fremont. He was taken out of the hotel all the while proclaiming his innocence and swore he would go back up to San Francisco to clear his good name. No word if they ever came to a settlement over the $25. <br id="lq3o"></p>

In their defense, it&#8217;s probably hard for bellboys and clerks to behave when the management did not always set a good example. In 1913, proprietor Richard A. Von Falkenberg was accused of drastically raising the rent on a female tenant when she refused his unwelcome advances. Von Falkenberg proclaimed his innocence. Three months later, when the hotel was in, as the Los Angeles Times stated, &quot;a precarious financial position,&quot; Von Falkenberg and his wife mysteriously dissappeared. Turns out, he was just suffering from ill nerves and decided to rest up in Ventura without notifying anyone.  </p>

<p>It is worth noting that just because someone was the owner of the Fremont, does not mean they were immune from the shadier goings on. In February of 1913, Fremont owner Mary Jauch (<a href="/node/98">former resident of the Rose Mansion</a>) reported $8,300 in jewels stolen from her room. The burgler had also entered the room of E.H. McElroy who caught the bandit red handed and the two scuffled until the theif got away. <br id="n0rf"><br>

The antics of the Fremont Hotel abruptly came to an end in the mid-1950s as the building was an early victim of the Community Redevelopment Agency&#8217;s grand plan for urban rewewal. By 1955, all that remained at the Southwest corner of 4th and Olive was the retaining wall that a long time ago separated the Fremont Hotel from the Olive Public School.</p>

		<p>Location: 355 South Grand Avenue<br>
Date: 1922-?<br>
<img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3050/2795648132_9f6cbbb046_o.png"><br>
When the Angel Michael spoke to Ruth Wieland in 1922, she was a Spring Street taxi dancer living on Bunker Hill. She first heard him as she walked along Broadway, then three days later in her room at 355 South Grand Avenue. Over the next 42 months he dictated the &quot;Lamb&#8217;s Book of Life&quot; to Ruth and her mother May Otis Blackburn, speaking occasionally, night and day&#8211;but only if they stayed inside and away from the bustle of everyday life.  In time, the handwritten book comprised such vast bulk that, at least according to May, it would have taken sixteen stenographers six months to transcribe it. <br>
<img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3260/2795616638_d0f199dc19.jpg"><br>
Much later, after the women were arrested for hustling oil man Clifford Dabney and their strange tale splashed across the papers, one Arthur C. Osborne appeared to announce he was Ruth&#8217;s bethrothed in those heady early days, when he loaned the girl $1500 to help finance her divorce. He told her she was too delicate to work, and that he would pay the bills while she and May worked on the holy book, also known as the Sixth Seal. Then she and mama vanished. He came to see Ruth in jail, but she was cold and told him to talk to her lawyer. <br>
<img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3144/2795616672_e9a700dbf9.jpg"><br>
For by 1929, pretty Ruth&#8217;s tastes had moved far beyond sad sack guys who loaned cash to taxi dancers. She was the priestess of The Divine Order of the Royal Arms of the Great Eleven, perhaps the wackiest in an era of wack-a-doodle cults and alternative faiths the likes of which continue to color California&#8217;s reputation for peculiarity to this day. With Mother May, Ruth commanded a small army of true believers who inhabited &quot;Harmony Hamlet,&quot; a retreat in the Santa Susanna mountains, near Moorpark (later the haunt of the Manson Family), where about 100 cult members lived like hermits after driving their cars into the mountains and leaving them to rust as a sign of devotion. But who needs wheels when you have nude, interracial dancing? Not you, mister.</p>
<p>The Great Eleven began on Bunker Hill and found its first faithful there. Ruth and May couldn&#8217;t spend all their time taking dictation from aetherial beings. They were social butterflies, the pair of them, and enjoyed sharing philosophy and bossing people around. Before long, both had found new husbands, Ruth with the doomed Sammie Rizzio, likely murdered in 1924 for the sin of striking his bride, May with weird Ward Blackburn, he of the Chinese moustaches, prodigious claws and fondness for collecting rainwater in a coffee can at the corner of Wilshire and Western. And it was likely on the Hill that Clifford Dabney found the ladies and became convinced that their holy book, once finished, would give him the power to discover hidden mineral wealth within the earth, to hold the power of life and death, and to reanimate the corpses he created while chugging along down Broadway in his customized human reaping machine and calliope. He began writing checks, which Ruth and May were only too happy to cash.<br>
<img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3272/2795616660_1b84a482c9.jpg"><br>
After several years, when all the money was gone, Clifford Dabney&#8217;s wealthy uncle <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dabney_Oil_Syndicate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joseph</a> took a break from berating his boozehound employee Raymond Chandler to offer his nephew a bail out, if he&#8217;d take those looney women to court. He did, and the story that came out ultimately included the symbolic exorcism of all the madness in the world via abusing a batch of crazy quilts, grandmas happily chained to their beds, ladies baked in brick ovens, poisoned sands, the abiding mystery of the Lord&#8217;s Furniture Set and the ritual mummification of a teenage priestess and her seven pet puppies. <br>

But these odd tales take us far from the Hill, and this is not the place for them. If you are curious about the Great Eleven, join us on the <a href="http://esotouric.com/wildwestside" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wild Wild West Side</a> crime bus tour, when we will visit the grave of the young mummy and talk at length of the practices of this most original downtown faith.</p>

One notable structure looming over Hill was the El Moro.  The Sanborn Maps in the <a href="/TheDirtPatchofSecondandHill" title="youdownwithDPP" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dirt Patch post </a>show us the house at 109 South Hill was built between 1888 and 1894.  This was the home of prominent Los Angeles druggist, and President of Western Wholesale Drug Company, Howard M. Sale, who had arrived from Pueblo, Colorado in 1886. Mr. and Mrs. Sale built <a href="http://209.85.141.104/search?q=cache:W4S4cIr-k8oJ:cityplanning.lacity.org/StaffRpt/CHC/5-6-08/CHC-2008-1177.pdf+%225027+El+Verano+Avenue%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1&amp;gl=us&amp;client=firefox-a" title="CCmusicfactory" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Castle Crag</a> in 1888 but decided Bunker Hill was the proper place to be, so sold out in &#8217;89 to build 109 South Hill. This house on the bluff was a center of Society for some years before Mr. and Mrs. Sale decided to turn it into a hotel in 1901 (moving into a larger house at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=james+m+wood+blvd+at+s+union+ave,+90015&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=65.772864,112.851563&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=34.051931,-118.273165&amp;spn=0.008587,0.013776&amp;t=h&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr" title="itainttherenow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ninth and Union</a> in 1902).  </p>

<p>With the Sale”&#x2122;s three-story addition to the  now-named El Moro, the structure extended back 133 feet and included a total of thirty-five rooms.  <br>

The El Moro”&#x2122;s location, some 150”&#x2122; above the sidewalk, made firefighting a little tricky, which aided in a near-total loss of the front portion of the mansion in January 1914.  There were thousands of spectators at the scene, and whether they turned out for the dramatic blaze or the sight of sixty some-odd guests in an early-morning state of deshabille is a matter of conjecture.   </p>

Mrs. Mollie Lahiff, 50, died of (what the papers termed) accidental asphyxiation after a gas heater used up all the oxygen in her tightly sealed room, February 26, 1953.  Should you be so inclined, consider how drafty these places tend to be.  Tightly sealed takes some doing.  Just saying.</p>
<p>And now, for your edification and delectation, the unhappy end of a streetcar just below the El Moro, 1937.</p>

<p>132/134 South Olive is one of the oldest stuctures on the block, dating to before &#8217;88.  Here&#8217;s a shot of the H-shaped building, next to our old pal, the Argyle.</p>

January 24, 1895. Mrs. Josie McGinn, a widow of 28 with a well-grown girl of 10, was sitting with her stepsister Grace in their home at 134 (in the image above, the one on the right), and Josie mentioned she was feeling poorly. Grace suggested a walk. At the foot of the terrace steps on Broadway Josie complained of feeling weak, but they continued down Franklin nonetheless. When they hit New High Street, Josie collapsed altogether. When asked what her trouble was, Josie replied, “I have taken laudanum.”&#157; She was taken to Receiving Hospital, where her life was saved, and there explained that while she was fixing her hair at the bureau in preparation for the walk downtown, there sat her glycerine and laudanum–intended for her ear condition–and in a moment of impulsive despair drank the laudanum. Such is the torment of modernity.</p>

Olive a room occupied by Mrs. Case was ransacked and liberated of $20). </p>

Harry Wilson was an actor who decided to take up newspaper work.  He was assigned to the police news, was as such often exposed to suicides down at Receiving Hospital.  This, it is thought, had a disturbing, destabilizing influence on his mind; Harry left a note for his wife on what he thought was going to be the last day of his life, October 8, 1904, and with that took the gas-pipe in their apartment in 425.  He survived, and with luck returned to neither tread board nor sling ink.</p>

A burglar was detected working the window at Mrs. M. M. Clay”&#x2122;s apartment house, 425, by her daughter, Clara Clay. She exclaimed under her breath to a Mr. Charles See, who kept the apartment above hers, “There”&#x2122;s a man trying my window.”&#157;</p>
<p>So See fetched his revolver and leaned out the upper story and commanded the man to hold up his hands. With a great bound the man leapt over a tall fence some four feet away, while See fired and missed. The burglar, well-dressed and polite as could be, broke through the back screen door at the adjoining apartment house at 421, strode lightly through the hall; he tipped his hat to a young lady in the hall and she replied “Good evening.”&#157; He stepped out on to the front porch where several roomers were sitting. He bade them all a good evening and, tipping his hat, walked slowly down the street. Moments later it was Charles See, feverish and gun-waving, who threw terror into the hearts of the tenants.</p>

July 22, 1924. Roy Shellington called 425 home, or at least he did until Federal prohibition officers noticed he was overly cautious in handling his suitcase while little doggies nipped at his heels. Shellington bunked in the hoosegow after the Feds found twelve bottles of Scotch inside, verboten in Volstead America.</p>

Alex Markovich, 33, lived at 425, but had the misfortune of making his way down to Third and Spring on December 28, 1953.  There he was jumped and beaten by hoodlums Alphonso Ruiz, Ramon Zaavedra, Gilbert Garcia, and”¦Mrs. Eleanor Talkington.  Luckily, while Markovich was in critical condition at General with a basal skull fracture, the perps were charged with suspicion of robbery and ADW after having been ID”&#x2122;d by eyewitnesses, who were none other than Joaquin Aquilar Robles, former Police Chief of Tijuana, and Rafael Estrada, ex-Mayor of Ensenada.</p>
<p>Not much to tell about 421/419, other than recommending one leap upon well-dressed gents tipping their hats with a “good evening,”&#157; as they”&#x2122;re bound to be window-pryers from next door.  Another piece of good advice is that once you”&#x2122;ve checked in, it”&#x2122;s best to <i>never set foot outside again</i>.  Especially if you”&#x2122;re an elderly gentleman.  On November 4, 1944, <img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3146/2793410845_b3f6bf225d_o.gif" alt="killercar" align="right" height="38" width="260">Mattie Mitchell, 70, departed his apartment at 421 and was run down by an LA Railway streetcar at Fifth and Hope.  Joseph Erolet, a 77 year-old news vender ventured outside of 421 on May 23, 1946, and was clobbered by an auto at Brand and Wilson in Glendale.  </p>
<p>And so concludes today”&#x2122;s report from this block, and the particular concavity that spawned the ongoing completist account of its whats and wherefores.   </p>
