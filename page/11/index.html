<p>As Bunker Hill developed from a fashionable Victorian neighborhood to an area of somewhat slummy dwellings, the grand mansions of the earlier era adapted with the times. In most cases, the large homes were converted into multi resident housing, sometimes a mere decade or two after construction. However, there are rare cases of Bunker Hill homes being inhabited by one family from the beginning to the bitter end, as was the case with the Larronde home at 237 North Hope Street. <br>
<!--break--><br>
At one time, the name Larronde was a fairly well known one in the City of Angels. Pierre Larronde was a native Frenchman who landed in San Francisco in 1847 and made a killing in the gold mines. When he relocated to Los Angeles in 1851, he amassed a further fortune by successfully raising sheep on one of the Ranchos. Always the astute businessman, Larronde cashed out his sheep empire in the late 1880s and focused his energies on real estate. His holdings included prime land at the corner of First and Spring, and a parcel on North Hope Street near Temple where he built the family home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</div>
<p>Pierre Larronde had a great deal in common with a fellow Los Angeles pioneer named Jean Etchemendy. Both men hailed from a south western region in France called the Basses-Pyrenees, both briefly lived in South America before cashing in early on the Gold Rush, and both successfully settled in Los Angles as sheep ranchers. Last but not least, both men married a gal named Juana Egurrola. Juana was born in Marquina, Spain but moved to California with her family at a very young age. She married Etchemendy in 1865 and gave birth to daughters Mariana, Madeleine and Carolina. Jean Etchemendy died in 1872 and Juana mourned for a couple of years before hooking up with the other French sheep-man in town. Juana’s 1874 union with Pierre Larronde produced three children, Pedro Domingo, John and Antoinette.</p>

Larronde House on 1888 &amp; 1950 Sanborn Map
</div>
<p>
The Sanborn Fire Insurance maps show the house on Hope Street as being under construction in 1888. The Larronde Bunch moved in shortly thereafter and held gatherings on a regular basis that made the society pages. Unlike many residences of Bunker Hill, the Larronde home suffered no scandals or controversies. Pierre the pioneer died in 1896, around the age of 70, and Juana resided on Hope Street until her death in 1920 at the ripe old age of 84.</p>

</div>
<p>Of the six Larronde/Etchemendy children, only two ventured off of Hope Street. Pedro Domingo would become a principal in the Franco American Baking Company and Antoinette married James J. Watson and had three children. John served as the head of the Fire Commission for a number of years and lived at 237 N. Hope Street until his death in 1954. The three Etchemendy girls also lived in the mansion for decades. Madeleine died shortly after her stepbrother in 1954, and Caroline and Mariana would live on for another decade. </p>
<p>For nearly eighty years, one family resided in the house at 237 North Hope Street. By the <br>
end of the 1960s, all traces of the Larronde/Etchemendy clan were erased from Bunker Hill.</p>

Accursed rings!  Hammer-mad Japanese!  Arms-manufacturing Baronesses!  Welcome to Zelda.</p>
<p>Somewhere in Los Angeles there’s a burglar who’s made off with more than he’s bargained for…<i>a maharajah’s curse</i>.  Somebody stole into the Zelda Apartments in March of 1941 and there into the room of Mrs. F. S. Tintoff, making off with a 400 year-old ring that held two large stones, a ruby and an emerald, surrounded by small diamonds.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3151/2726620001_e3c8a3d0ec_o.gif" alt="DeathCurse!" height="117" width="575"></p>
<p>“It was given to me by my husband, a jeweler, who purchased it from a maharajah.  The ring formerly adorned an East India princess, and was supposed to have been given a mysterious Oriental curse which would bring death to the person who stole it,”&#157; said Mrs. Tintoff.    The burglar took other jewelry which with the ring had a value of $560 ($8,196 USD2007), and two other tenants in the apartment building reported similartly burgled jewelry losses to police, but nothing thereof with a curse upon’t.  The Tintoff ring thus joins other bloodstained jewels of the East, like the <a href="https://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/science/article2935508.ece" title="Dehlicious" target="_blank">Dehli Purple Sapphire</a>, the <a href="https://www.underworldtales.com/hope.htm" title="eyeforaneye" target="_blank">stolen</a>-from-the-Eye-of-Sita <a href="https://www.pbs.org/treasuresoftheworld/a_nav/hope_nav/hnav_level_2/level2_pitch_curse_hopfrm.html" title="abandonhope" target="_blank">Hope</a> <a href="https://www.pbs.org/treasuresoftheworld/a_nav/hope_nav/main_hopfrm.html" title="cantwejustgiveitback" target="_blank">Diamond</a> and the similarly snatched <a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/4262862.stm" title="orlovofmoney" target="_blank">Black Orlov</a>.  And that deadly ring of <a href="https://www.unsolvedmysteries.com/usm352194.html" title="verysheik" target="_blank">Valentino</a>.</p>
<p>Did our housebreaker lose this cursed thing to the ages as he writhed in some forlorn torment somewhere?  Were his last days exactly like <a href="https://www.vnn.org/editorials/ET0204/ET22-7278.html" title="justatypicalweekonbunkerhill" target="_blank">this</a>?  Or perhaps the curse was purely <a href="https://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article1596823.ece" title="curseofthelawyers" target="_blank">legalistic</a>. </p>
<p>What, or who, is Zelda?  Zelda La Chat (née Keil) was born in 1870, arriving in Los Angeles some time in the 90s.  She builds the eponymous Zelda, a modest bargeboard affair at the southwest corner of <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=401+S+Grand+Ave,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90071&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=69.738802,113.203125&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=34.052819,-118.252652&amp;spn=0.009138,0.013819&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr" title="401SG" target="_blank">Fourth and Grand</a>, here, about 1904:</p>

She lives therein until she dies of cerebral hemorrhage in 1926; she leaves an estate valued at $300,000 ($3,521,554 USD2007).</p>

Nine year-old Beatrice Denton, to whom Baroness von Zimmerman was benefactress, was supposed to be a beneficiary of the estate, but the Baroness never got around to those formalities.  Foundling Beatrice became once again an orphan and was likely returned to the asylum from which she was plucked.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3131/2726620093_eb0dbe667a_o.gif" alt="assaultsuccessor" align="left" height="111" width="429">Yes, there&#8217;s never a lack of excitement at the Zelda. Take by example the May 1916 discharge of Zelda’s porter George “an erratic Japanese”&#157; Nakamoto. Having been sacked by La Chat, and replaced by one K. Kitagawa, Nakamoto saw fit to return to the Zelda to seek out his successor. There was Kitagawa, crouched low, tacking down oilcloth in a cubbyhole beneath a stairway; Nakamoto grabbed a riveting hammer and struck him repeatedly on the head, injuring his skull, and sending him to Receiving hospital in critical condition.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3287/2726615643_ed65db3e35_o.gif" alt="damestoo" align="right" height="218" width="257">And then there was the night of March 10, 1939, when vice squads in Los Angeles in Beverly Hills came down on bookmaking establishments; seventeen were arrested, including James Adams, 48; George Taylor, 24; James Roberts, 26; Mrs. Agnes Meyers, 36, and Yvonne Lucas, 21, whom Central Vice took offense to the making of book in an apartment at the Zelda. (Interestingly, across Hollywood and Beverly Hills, the pinched bookmakers more often than not had names like Murray Oxhorn and Morris Levine and Saul Abrams and Joseph Blumenthal; could our Zelda perchance have been a bit…<i>restricted</i>?)</p>
<p>Postwar Zelda was full of fun too. Joseph M. Marcelino, 21, was just another ex-Marine who worked in a box factory. When he got nabbed on October 4, 1950, while burglarizing an apartment in the Gordon at 618 West 4th, he copped to having set fire to the Zelda, aflame at that very moment. He admitted as well to torching another hotel at 322 South Spring. He was freed without bail pending a psychiatric examination. But come April, when he broke into a factory at 1013 Santa Barbara Ave. and stole company checks, which he made payable to himself and cashed, the police came knocking.<br>
<img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3258/2727440112_6a357b4591_o.gif" alt="andforgery" height="101" width="440">Marcelino had also attempted to lift a safe and had lost part of his fingernail in the process—the cops found they had the perfect match.</p>
<p>But the winds of change blew foul in 1954. Sure, people waved their arms and preached the evils of gingerbread ornament and its relationship to tuberculosis, but when you came right down to it, <i>The Hill impeded traffic flow</i>. A new project, known as the 4th Street Cut, began that Summer, involving a 687-foot viaduct shooting eastward from the Harbor Freeway, carrying four lanes of one-way traffic above Figureora and Flower, then biting into the hill and passing beneath bridges at Hope and Grand before dipping down into the business district. Through the early 1950s there was much controversy over this plan—proponents of a tunnel argued that a cut would “hopelessly bisect”&#157; Bunker Hill. What they didn’t realize was that soon enough, there’d be no Bunker Hill to bisect.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3041/2726620439_b5047b79ff_o.gif" alt="whyaduck" height="476" width="575"></p>
<p>
Fourth Street, in becoming a cut, and Grand, in becoming a bridge, meant one thing: the surrounding buildings would have to go. And so they did. The Zelda was razed in August of 1954:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3121/2726619019_ae047e4026_o.gif" alt="demotime" height="414" width="575"></p>
<p>Seen being demo’d next to the Zelda is the Gordon at 618 West 4th (you remember, the place Marcelino was nabbed in in ’50); the Gordon, the Bronx at 624 and the La Belle at 630 West 4th were all torn down to make way for the Cut—a trio built by the sons of Dr. <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/node/133" title="DrJohn" target="_blank">John C. Zahn</a>.</p>
<p>All this brought a twinge of regret to Percy Howell, the veteran city appraiser who spent two years tramping the Hill, working out fair payments for displaced property owners.  Howell remembered his young bachelor days on Bunker Hill back in 1909, when he moved into the Zelda, “batching it”&#157; with three other gay blades.   “I never dreamed then,”&#157; said Howell, “that I would live to see the day when I condemned the Zelda for the city.”&#157;<br>

<p>The 4th Street Cut opened May 1, 1956.</p>
<p>A new an improved 4th St., looking east ca. 1964, foundation excavation for the <a href="https://www.you-are-here.com/los_angeles/union_bank.html" title="UBH&amp;A" target="_blank">Union Bank</a> in the foreground:</p>

<p>Another shot of the viaduct (I know, why-a no chicken?) ca. 1973, during  erection of <a href="https://www.you-are-here.com/los_angeles/bank_america.html" title="youdownwithSPP" target="_blank">Security Pacific Plaza</a>. </p>

<p>For twenty-five years after Zelda’s demolition, nothing could stem the march of progress:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3031/2726621089_a6605dbb4a_o.gif" alt="unstoppable!" height="517" width="400"></p>
<p>It has filled in now, to be fair.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3216/2727444870_b817aabfe9_o.gif" alt="4thGrandaerial" height="322" width="575"></p>

<p>And so goes Zelda La Chat, her Zelda, and 4th Street, though all we have to show for the former glory of 401 South Grand is the pointy backside of <a href="https://www.you-are-here.com/los_angeles/mellon_bank.html" title="MellonHeads" target="_blank">400 South Hope</a>.</p>

<p>
Louis Burgess Greenslade, a native of Devon, England and better known as Lewis, The Light, was already balmy in January 1889, when Doctors Field and Fitch of Bellevue Hospital sent him to the Hart Island asylum, off Manhattan.</p>
<p>He had been institutionalized after his neglected wife came from Pasadena in response to a letter from Louis stating that one of their sons, who was traveling with him, was dying. She sold everything she had to finance the trip, where she discovered her child was quite well, but Louis —not so much.</p>
<p>Some time later Louis left the asylum to rejoin his family in California, where he found his wife had died after telling neighbors she was a widow, and that his children had been put into public care. He moved to downtown Los Angeles, where he grew a long beard, dressed &quot;in fantastic garb,&quot; declared himself a messiah and lived on the donations of true believers. </p>
<p>An investigation resulted in him being declared unfit to rear his daughter Calla Lily (aged 14 in 1891), and he went to court seeking her release, then tried to snatch her from Mrs. Watson&#8217;s Home. He was tried on grounds of insanity, but freed because the thrifty law required homicidal or suicidal tendencies if a madman was to be cared for in an asylum. He tried to make a speech to the court, was rebuffed, and in January 1892 was determined to be in fact dangerous and committed to the State Insane Asylum at Agnews (a village later absorbed by Santa Clara). </p>
<p>But by June he was reported to be handing out peculiar circulars outside Metropolitan Hall in San Francisco, and in October arrested in that city on a charge of having torched the Turnverein Hall. In April 1894 he was sent back to the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/history/nr/travel/santaclara/agn.htm" target="_blank">asylum at Agnews</a>, a place he claimed was ideal for &quot;resting and fattening up.&quot; (Lucky Lewis was not at the trough in April 1906, when the institution collapsed in the great earthquake, killing 117 patients and staff. All were buried on the grounds, which now comprise the supposedly haunted Sun Microsystems campus.)</p>
<p><img src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3295/2730434552_63c5ceb9b8_o.jpg"></p>
<p>Satisfied with his care and the width of his belly, Lewis escaped and returned to San Francisco, where he was arrested after ripping open his clothing and asking passersby to witness the divine light that burned in his breast.</p>
<p>For the rest of 1894, through 1895, 1896 and 1897 there was no sign of Lewis the Light. But in January 1898 he made a triumphant return to Los Angeles, tossing down a hand-written message at the feet of the deaf-mute newsstand operator Max Cohn at 124 ½ South Spring Street.</p>
<p>&quot;Max: Read this intelligently and with interest! Deaf mutes are caused by the unnatural crime of rebelling against Lewis the Light! All nature, together with humanity, groans for lack of using Lewis the Light! Whilst people are such unnatural fools as to breed mules, there will also be deaf mutes to suffer for it. Greater than the ram&#8217;s horn is the horn of the he-goat.&quot; LEWIS THE LIGHT</p>
<p>He was at this time living atÂ  230 South Olive Street with two of his sons who worked as messengers and supported the family. By July 1898, the L.A. Times already sounded sick of him when reporting &quot;Los Angeles is again afflicted with [his] prophecies.&quot;</p>
<p>Lewis the Light, you see, what a newspaper reader and a letter writer. He&#8217;d comb the papers for reports of some personal catastrophe, then send a note (or many notes) preaching doom and damnation to the unfortunate sufferer, with the promise that future traumas could be avoided if they could only consult him, and tithe accordingly. (That fire in San Francisco was just another subject that drew his interest, but only after the fact.) Hence in July &#8217;98, E.T. Earl had to contend not only with the loss of his Wilshire boulevard home to fire, but with an original missive from Lewis, The Light:</p>
<p>&quot;Armageddon, allegorically and literally. Now Earl: count yourself as having been subjected to one variety, at least of Fire, and liable to many others through utterly failing to do your duty in personally and practically recognizing and rendering his due to the Lord of Life. Deut. 3-15, 32-22.&quot; </p>
<p>The message was signed with a rubber stamp showing a horse and an invitation to visit &quot;Lewis, the Light, accident preventer&quot; at this address. Mr. Earl called the cops, and Louis was warned to knock off with the nasty notes (particularly the letters to women, which were especially racy) or he&#8217;d be shipped back to the bug house. A record was made of his business card, which read, &quot;Accident preventer, central civilizer, longevity promoter; subject to nothing; terms a tithe.&quot;</p>
<p>In May 1899, one of Louis&#8217; sons, his 22-year-old namesake, flipped out after reading too deeply in the scientific section of the public library. The young man, who fancied himself an inventor, went into the basement offices of his employers, the California District messenger service beneath the Los Angeles National Bank and began smashing windows, furnishings and bicycles. He was subdued and taken to the County Hospital, where he raved he had &quot;been doped.&quot; Facing the judge, young Louis frothed maniacally and tore at his chains while the father calmly answered questions about his son&#8217;s mental state. The boy was committed to the Highland asylum after becoming so unruly he had to be removed from the courtroom.</p>
<p>On March 2, 1901, at 2pm, there was a conflict in Central Park (now Pershing Square), when Lewis the Light&#8217;s prediction of the second coming of Christ was scheduled for the same hour as a concert by the Catalina Marine Band. This disrespect so incensed Lewis that J.M. Garrison, the park foreman, called for police protection at the holy hour. According to a petition then circulating (with 800 signatures to date), the park had become something of an eyesore due to the &quot;[infestation of] loafers an bums to such an extent that its usefulness to the populace as an airing-place is destroyed.&quot;</p>
<p>The petition read: &quot;We, the undersigned, residents of Los Angeles, respectfully petition that legal means be employed to abate the public nuisance of the large gathering of men and boys daily in the band stand at Central Park. We are persuaded that the public haranguing at the park destroys the attractiveness of the place, interferes with the rights of the public, and exercises an immoral influence, especially upon the young boys, whose minds are constantly filled with false views of nature and of life. Much of the talk at the band stand we believe to be blasphemous, although a few conscientious men do endeavor daily to antidote this poison, we believe their efforts are in the main futile, and we believe its abatement a great necessity.&quot; It was filed in city council, alongside a contrasting petition presented by John Murray, Junior of the Socialist Democratic Party, in support of free speech. And of course, Lewis the Light had an opinion about the matter.</p>
<p><img src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3122/2729566411_b5a2f5b486_o.png"></p>
<p>As could be expected, the September 1901 assassination of President William McKinley drew the attention of Lewis the Light (then age 49), and after he penned some of his typical missives (signed &quot;Umbilical Cord of the Universe, Potentate of Prosperity&quot;) convinced the Eastern recipients that he was a dangerous anarchist. Local detectives knew him as a harmless crank, but nonetheless took him into custody as a courtesy to their colleagues in the east. Arrested at his Olive Street abode, Louis snapped &quot;You can&#8217;t do me any harm, for I am Jesus Christ.&quot; In court he proclaimed his opposition to anarchy, and claimed he was the only person to speak out against Red Emma Goldman during her visit to Los Angeles. Unimpressed, Judge Shaw proclaimed him insane</p>
<p>In 1907, Lewis the Light crossed paths with author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who inquired with Los Angeles police about some mysterious letters sent in his care to <a href="https://www.siracd.com/life_case1.shtml" target="_blank">George Edalji</a>, whose conviction false on charges of animal cruelty Doyle helped eradicate via a most <a href="https://www.historynet.com/sir-arthur-conan-doyle-the-case-of-george-edalji.htm" target="_blank">Holmesian investigation</a>. The Edalji family&#8217;s troubles had begun with anonymous letters, but local police were able to soothe their concerns when they assured Doyle that neither their local crank nor his recent roommate Frank Sharp had anything but an idle interest in their affairs. One side effect of Doyle&#8217;s interest was the discovery that Louis Greenslade had left England after annoying a Sir Henry Knight with weird letters.</p>
<p>In 1908, Lewis the Light was charged with vagrancy and sentenced to thirty days after annoying citizens who he threatened should they refuse to pay a tithe. This would be the last appearance of this colorful character in the pages of the L.A. Times, and before long, his name, once an object of glee and fascination, sank into obscurity.</p>

On the afternoon of August 21, 1924, residents of <street w:st="on"><address w:st="on">328 Clay Street</address></street> were terror stricken by weird noises emanating from a room on the second floor of the building. There were scuffling sounds and urgent whisperings – all of which sounded ominous enough to draw the attention of several residents in adjacent rooms. A few of the braver souls crept along the corridor until they were near enough to the room to hear voices.

A woman cried out “O, Henry! You wouldn’t do that! Oh, no! No! No! Henry, For God’s sake!”&#157; The woman then emitted a blood-curdling shriek which ended in a choking moan. The eavesdroppers shuddered.
</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
The deep guttural voice of a man snarled “You lied, you she-devil. You lied and lied, but if I swing into hell for it, you’ll never leave here to lie again.”&#157;
</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
As if mortally wounded, the woman wailed one last time. The hallway Sherlocks heard the sharp ring of metal a heartbeat later, as though a long steel knife had been flung to the floor.

The spooked tenants waited for a few seconds, then rushed to their telephones. Moments later in the captain’s office at Central Police Station, three phones rang in unison. After deciphering the frantic messages, police concluded that each caller was reporting a murder at <street w:st="on"><address w:st="on">328 Clay Street</address></street>.
</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">

<p style="margin: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
Officer Voy K. Apt was dispatched immediately. With sirens blaring, the cop raced to the scene.<span>Â  </span>A group of frightened people waited on the building’s second floor landing, hoping that police would unravel the mystery of the crime committed through a closed door.

<p style="margin: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
Revolver in hand, Apt was directed to a room at the rear of the building. He drew a deep breath and then burst through the door. The spectators waited for an all clear signal, but what they heard instead was “Well, I’ll be…!”&#157;<span>Â Â  </span>Awaiting the armed officer in the death chamber were members of a dramatic club rehearsing a murder scene – using a bread knife.

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Having spent the earthquake today underground on the Wilshire/Vermont subway platform, I, for one, am grateful for the building codes and seismic retrofits of today.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3274/2715431475_01ea2fe04b.jpg" width="342" height="433" align="left" alt="unshaken">And the downtown Los Angeles of today came through the quake swimmingly, with the most significant damage being sustained by the Literature &amp; Fiction Department at Central Library, which was briefly closed this afternoon after many of its books were flung from the shelves by tremors.</p>
<p>However, everyone knows that Southern California hasn&#8217;t always escaped these quakes quite so unscathed.  For today&#8217;s Bunker Hill time travel, let&#8217;s step back to the Long Beach Earthquake of 1933.</p>
<p>Centered on the Newport-Inglewood Fault, the 6.4 quake hit Southern California in the early evening on March 10, 1933.  Rubble filled the streets, fires broke out, and approximately 120 people were killed in the quake, with hundreds more injured filling the Southland&#8217;s hospitals.  The cities of Long Beach, Compton, Watts, Huntington Park, and Huntington Beach were particularly hard hit.</p>
<p>Though downtown and the Bunker Hill area fared better, there were more than a few close shaves.</p>
<p>At 130 S. Broadway, 19-year-old Morgan Gordon was sitting in his car when two 3-foot square blocks plummeted from the cornice of the building.  One crashed through the car&#8217;s hood, the other through its roof, fortunately, landing in the empty passenger seat.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3203/2715431579_2aee2d3082.jpg" width="500" height="385" align="right" alt="crushed cars">Nearby, witnesses watched in horror as the tops of the Federal Building, the Hall of Justice, and City Hall swayed visibly, and the screams of prisoners being held on the top three floors of the Hall of Justice could be heard from the street below:  &quot;We want out!  We want out!&quot;</p>
<p>Paint was literally knocked off of all four exterior walls of the Hall of Records, broken glass filled the streets, and people were struck and injured by falling bricks and debris (though no downtown fatalities were reported).</p>
<p>Dramatic as the scene downtown was, the long-term damage was limited.  Most of the debris was cleared over the weekend, and of all the large buildings in the area, only three were deemed potentially unsafe:  the Detwiler Building at 412 W. Sixth, the Edison Building at Broadway and Third, and the Great Republic Life Buildling at 756 S. Spring.  In all, the damage to downtown buildings was estimated at a relatively modest $250,000 ($4.2 million USD 2007).</p>

		<p><b>Tales From Bunker Hill</b> is a 45-60 minute multi-media presentation consisting of some of our favorite posts featured on the On Bunker Hill blog, a presentation of an original map of the neighborhood, and a brief look at the forces which created and shaped the current Bunker Hill (this portion is a short introduction to the themes of the four-hour Esotouric bus adventure <a href="https://esotouric.com/secretdowntown">The Lowdown on Downtown</a>). The presentation concludes with a question and answer period. If interested in booking this lecture, kindly <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/feedback">email</a> us.Â </p>
<p>More info: <img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3112/2682890676_e6c0b12ecc_m.jpg" align="right" width="240" height="183">Bunker Hill was the first grand Los Angeles neighborhood to flourish outside the bright and dusty Plaza. It was home to the city’s finest families, who built exquisite gingerbread houses with hillside gardens that reflected their wealth and taste. A jaunty funicular delivered residents into the midst of downtown’s commercial center. It was the pride of the west.</p>
<p>Yet somehow, through the vagaries of decades of bust and boom, Bunker Hill became a carbuncle on downtown, filled with social misfits and pensioners, just another deficit in the tax base. By the 1950s, it seemed the only solution to this urban social problem was for the city to reclaim and redevelop.</p>
<p>Or was it? With its demolition went the testament and legacy of a rich and varied community, a densely populated downtown which today’s developers can only dream of. The On Bunker Hill blog was launched in Spring 2008 by a consortium of writers, social historians, librarians and tour guides to shine a light upon this lost community, its demolished mansions, famous and infamous citizens, and the forgotten lessons of downtown’s most successful residential community.</p>
<p>Our goal with this project is to unearth the lost stories of old Bunker Hill, because they are interesting, instructive, and timely, and because those who forget the past are doomed to make the same mistakes their ancestors made.</p>

		<p>Location: 121 North Flower Street</p>
<p>On December 10, 1925, road crew worker W.A. Conway of this address demonstrated exactly how tough were the inhabitants of Bunker Hill. He began the day getting blasted in the head by a misplaced explosive charge on the Edward Lynch property on North Louise Street in Glendale, resuming work after receiving six stitches. Not long after his return, steam shovel engineer Tom Adams told powder man L.J. Starkey to set off a charge of black powder in the hole. The explosion destroyed the steam shovel, sent rocks and debris raining down, and was dropped souffles all over Glendale. Conway was unhurt by this second blast, but we hope he took the hint and found a more careful crew to work with.<br>
Â <br>
On January 3, 1935, A.E. Kelly of this address had the dubious distinction of being the agent of death for Harold Wilburn, aged 60, who stepped in front of Kelly&#8217;s automobile at Fifth and Wall Streets.Â  The accident was explained as caused by the victim being &quot;confused by traffic,&quot; but the location of the incident (the corner anchored by the notorious Hard Rock Cafe) suggests Mr. Wilburn may have been lit up like a Christmas tree before stepping out into oblivion.</p>

Mrs. Clark, landlady of the rooming house at <street w:st="on"><address w:st="on">421 S. Hill Street</address></street>, thought she had seen it all. But she hadn’t – not by a long shot.
</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
It was May 27, 1905, and Mrs. Clark was tidying up around the place. She may have been reflecting on the odd assortment of lodgers currently in residence, particularly Professor J. Maclane. The so-called professor advertised himself as a spiritualist, and Mrs. Clark and her renters were treated to the nightly spectacle of his devotees floating about the premises, seeking to commune with deceased spirits.
</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
<img loading="lazy" border="0" align="middle" width="255" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3289/2696142670_29b310409f_o.jpg" alt="Prof Maclane" height="97">Â 
</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
While she mused about the spiritualist fakir, it’s unlikely that she gave any thought at all to Mr. and Mrs. Harry Holley, a pleasant married couple who had moved into the house a few days earlier.<span>Â  </span>They had been occupying a room on an upper floor, but when the larger room adjacent to them became available, they’d jumped at the chance to rent it.Â 
</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
Because the Holleys were out for the day, the landlady decided to do the couple a favor, and began to move some of their belongings into their new room.<span>Â  </span>It was probably the last time in her life that Mrs. Clark would act on a generous impulse. When she swung the door open and entered the room, she nearly stepped on an enormous slithering reptile!<span>Â  </span>Quickly looking around to assess any further danger, she spied another, even larger snake coiled up in a chair across the room. The serpent met her gaze and began to hiss, and that was enough for the landlady. She slammed the door and careened down the stairs, screaming for help.
</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
The only lodger who didn’t immediately come out to see what all the ruckus was about was the bogus professor.<span>Â  </span>When he finally poked his head out of his room, his only comment was “It isn’t a snake, it’s the spirit of a dear departed sister”&#157;.<span>Â  </span>Mrs. Clark didn’t want to hear it. Departed sister or not – all she wanted was to get the snakes out of the house.
</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
The panic stricken woman phoned the local precinct house, saying “Send some policemen and a patrol wagon quick, my house is full of snakes!”&#157;<span>Â  </span>To which the jaded desk sergeant replied “Snakes, eh, you say you got’em?”&#157;<span>Â  </span>If she could have done so, the exasperated woman would have reached through the telephone lines and throttled the cop into unconsciousness.<span>Â  </span>Finally, after what must have seemed like an eternity to the anxious Mrs. Clark, the desk sergeant said that he’d connect her with the police surgeon, Dr. Quint, whom the bluecoat declared was an “…authority on snakes”&#157;.
</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;
</p>

Across the crackling telephone wire, Dr. Quint heard someone say “Is that the snake doctor?”&#157; Dr. Quint told the shaken woman that he’d been called many things in his time, but never a snake doctor. Mrs. Clark then recounted her tale of serpents, fakirs, and terror – oh my. The good doctor suggested that she simply wait for her snake handling lodgers to return, and then demand that they remove the creatures at once.

The Holleys arrived home to find all of the inhabitants of 421 S.

		<p>By 1952, most of the lovely Melrose Hotel&#8217;s 200 occupants were elderly pensioners &#8212; elderly pensioners with exciting, glamorous, Auntie Mame-esque pasts.</p>
<p>First there&#8217;s the Melrose Hotel&#8217;s parttime switchboard operator, Anna Pearce, a former singer on the Considine vaudeville circuit around the turn of the century.</p>
<p>The hotel is also home to Juliet de Grazi, a Swahili-speaking Austrian-born soprano who toured with a Belgian opera company through the cities of East Africa.  In 1952, de Grazi was simply passing<br>
through the Melrose.  She had recently won a large settlement in an automobile accident, and was planning to return to East Africa where her husband was buried.</p>
<p>And Beulah Monroe was a fixture on the local theatre scene, making her debut in Oscar Wilde&#8217;s <i>The Ideal Husband</i> in 1919, opposite <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Everett_Horton" title="norton" target="_blank">Edward Everett Horton</a>.  She appeared frequently at the Little Theatre at Figueroa and Pico, and also acted with Florence Roberts, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallace_Beery" title="beery" target="_blank">Wallace Beery</a>, and Neely Edwards during her career.</p>

<p>Of the two cable car lines that ran through Bunker Hill in the late 1880s, the <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/node/156" title="Second Street Cable Railway">Second Street Railway</a> was the first to be financed and functioning, but the Temple Street line would prove to be more durable and longer lasting. While the cable cars of Los Angeles are now just a very small footnote in the city&#8217;s history, the Temple Street Railway was for years, a reliable mainstay for Bunker Hill residents in the waning days of the Victorian era.</p>
<div style="text-align: center">

</div>
<p>Cable cars did not come to Los Angeles until 1885, even though a local paper suggested in 1882 that a line running up Temple and over to the Normal School (where the Central Library now stands) would be a good idea. The Temple Street line was conceived of around the same time as its Second Street counterpart, but while the latter immediately had investors reaching into deep pockets, the raising of funds for the Temple cable cars was slower going. A month after the Second Street line was completed, the Temple Street Cable Car Railway Company was finally able to incorporate with a Board of Directors that included Walter S Maxwell, Victor Beaudry, Ralph Rogers, Thomas Stovell, Julius Lyons, E.A. Wall, O. Morgan, Prudent Beaudry and John Milner.</p>

<p>
Work on the line began in December of 1885 and was estimated to be completed by the following May. Unlike the Second Street line which was constructed rapidly to capitalize on the real estate boom of the 1880s, the Temple line was built with considerably more care. Completion of the railway was delayed, mainly due to wait times on parts ordered from around the country, and the Temple Street cable car made its eagerly awaited inaugural trip through Bunker Hill on July 14, 1886.</p>

<p>The Temple line cost $90,000 to construct (around 2 million in today&#8217;s dollars) and would require roughly 600 passengers a day, each way, to make a profit. The cars, built by the John Stephenson Co of New York, held fourteen passengers and according to the Los Angeles Times, “are models of elegance and easy motion.”&#157; The line initially ran 1.6 miles up Temple from Spring to Belmont, and would eventually be extended to Hoover in an area then known as Dayton Heights. Unlike the failed attempt of the Second Street line to connect with the Cahuenga Valley Railroad, the Temple Railway was   successfully connected with the steam cars which allowed passengers to transfer from one line to another and travel out to Hollywood.</p>

<p>Tragedy struck the Temple Street Cable Railway on the morning of January 16, 1892 when James Brown, a 51 year old employee of the railway company for six years, was killed in a freak accident. Every day, Brown would oil the wheels from the end of the line up to the powerhouse on Edgeware near Echo Park. On the fateful morning, a piece of Brown&#8217;s clothing was caught between a cable and the wheel. The speed of the wheel pulled his arm off and as the Times reported, “he was terribly mangled around the head and face, and several bones were crushed, so that death must have almost been instantaneous.”&#157;  Almost a year later, Brown&#8217;s widow would be awarded $20,000 from the Temple Street Railway Company.</p>

<p>Great flooding in 1889 would obliterate the Second Street line, but the better built Temple railway would persevere with little interruption to service and would carry 1.5 million passengers by year&#8217;s end. This would prove to be the pinnacle for the line, which never turned much of a profit and was near bankruptcy by 1897. The cars managed to chug along for another few years, but by 1902 they were breaking down frequently and many residents opted to walk along the rails instead of waiting to catch a ride on these relics of a bygone era. The railway was purchased by railroad magnate Henry Huntington in late 1901 who would eventually make the line an electric one. On November 18, 1902, the cable cars on Temple Street officially stopped running.</p>
