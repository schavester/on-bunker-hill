		<p>Location: 240 South Grand Avenue<br>
Date: September 14, 1904</p>
<p>For about a year, from summer 1902 to spring 1903, Broadway strollers might hear exquisite sounds of healing emerging from the windows at 529 South Broadway, where the &quot;skilled physicians&quot; of The E. M. M. Curative Company practiced their pseudoscientific arts with electrical devices, x-rays, and gizmos that gave off heat, light, musical waves and faradic emanations (gals, you may be familiar with these last if you own a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000K8ALI8/ref=nosim/bubblegumbook">portable massage unit</a>). </p>
<p><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3137/2988607499_e843db52b5.jpg"></p>
<p>Standing for Electro Musical Magneto, and using a unique <a href="http://www.google.com/patents?id=P09hAAAAEBAJ&amp;pg=PA2&amp;lpg=PA2&amp;dq=%22e.+m.+m.+curative%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=U7gXmha_LR&amp;sig=lNXQzOsNp1N9wC9TOW1V7Hf0MXU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ct=result">patented device</a> created by Henry Fleetwood, this interesting agency regrettably failed to leave any evidence of customers satisfied or otherwise. Incorporated in March 1902 with $200,000 in capital stock, the company was run by Fleetwood, D.W. Stewart, Herbert M. Pomeroy, lon [sic] L. Clark and Walter Rose.</p>
<p>It was a partnership quickly marred by tragedy, with treasurer and medical director Pomeroy, 38 and a drug addict, committing suicide by morphine in July 1902, out of an overwhelming urge to flee the world of the living and be with his dead mother again. Pomeroy, of 950 West Washington Street, left a note to his partner and personal attorney Rose asking him to cover up the cause of death and to be kind to the wife and babe he left behind. Rose and Pomeroy&#8217;s personal physician O.D. (you can&#8217;t make these names up) Fitzgerald tried to honor Pomeroy&#8217;s wishes, but in stealing the body away to a private mortuary before the authorities were called so incensed Coroner Holland that he had the contents of the suicide note released to the press.</p>
<p>We next hear of the practitioners of Fleetwood&#8217;s methods on September 14, 1904, when young Frederick B. West, a physician who was formerly a prominent fixture at The E. M. M. Curative Company before relocating to San Diego, was arrested at his sister&#8217;s home 240 South Grand Avenue on a murder charge relating to the death of Isabella Camello, 19. The girl was alleged to have gone to West in San Diego to procure an illegal operation, the incompetent performance of which resulted in her death. West insisted that while he had treated the girl for a stomach ailment, perhaps with a vibrating wand that gave off flashes of light and musical tones, he had not performed an abortion. The case was not reported on further, leaving us just the briefest glimpse of the world of quack medicine in Edwardian L.A.</p>

		<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3163/2961815505_1fa14ca585_o.gif" alt="fromthetrailer" height="271" width="479">Bunker Hill of old is gone, never to be again.  Until we concoct some Disneyesque Colonial Williamsburgian simulacrum, complete with sullen teenagers hired to pose as grimy grifters, we’ll never be able to amble down Third toward Hill and catch Angels Flight up to battenboard and gingerbread.  (Imagine, the collapse of the Vanderbilt will be repeated at two, four, and six!  Visit  the souvenir stand outside the Elmar!  We <i>gotta</i> get Eco on board.  Dang, too bad Baudrillard just died.)</p>
<p>But the Hill did rise again, for one brief moment, when Robert “Chinatown”&#157; Towne said <i>full speed ahead</i>, we’re building this thing.  We’ve got <i>Ask the Dust</i> to film.  And with all that devalued Rand, what did they build down in a Capetown rugby field?  A presumptuous pastiche.  A goofy Golem.  A dopey doppelgänger.  </p>
<p>Bear in mind this post is less a criticism than an investigation, because it’s not so much they got it <i>wrong</i> as they got it <i>weird</i>.  </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3240/2963143040_15ee8075e9_o.gif" alt="AtD" align="right" height="300" width="200">What is this <i>Asking of Dust</i>, you ask?  Fine, a little background.  It’s the 1930s, and while the world was awash in novels of the mannered drawing-room variety, aspiring writer John Fante was banging out gritty realism, as best he could, considering that at every turn he’d find the “mechanism of [his] new typewriter glutted with sand.”&#157;  This is the titular dust, the tiny brown grains that’d blow in from the Mojave, that’d get in his hair and ears and find its way into the bedsheets of his little room at the Alta Loma, his Bunker Hill flop.  </p>
<p><i>Ask the Dust</i> <u>is</u> Bunker Hill.  And <i>AtD</i>’s protagonist Arturo Bandini is our displaced dago everyman, there at the Alta Loma, built on the hillside in reverse: he climbs out the window and scales the incline to the top of the Hill and walks “down Olive Street past a dirty yellow apartment house still wet like a blotter from last night’s fog.”&#157;  Via Fante/Bandini’s description, the Hill takes on all necessary romance and despair:</p>
<p align="justify">
<i>I went up to my room, up the dusty stairs of Bunker Hill, past the soot-covered frame buildings along that dark street, sand and oil and grease choking the futile palm trees standing like dying prisoners, chained to a little plot of ground with black pavement hiding their feet.  Dust and old buildings and old people sitting at windows, old people tottering out of doors, old people moving painfully along the dark street.</i>
</p>
<p>(In actuality, Fante wrote Ask the Dust in a [<a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=berendo&amp;w=34632809%40N00" title="thanktheCity" target="_blank">recently-demolished</a>] <a href="http://www.meenophoto.com/fantehouseslideshow/" title="HouseofFante" target="_blank">pad</a> on Berendo.  But he <i>had</i> lived at the <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/taxonomy/term/115" title="theAVclub" target="_blank">Alta Vista</a>, seen here&#8230;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3147/2951656699_5a78d9373f_o.gif" alt="theAltaVista" height="498" width="450"></p>
<p>&#8230;.and whose plot is now here:)</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3141/2951656881_4e6089de79_o.gif" alt="theyellowofcowardice" height="321" width="450"></p>
<p>Anyway.  Robert Towne reads the 1939-published <i>Ask the Dust</i> in 1971 while doing research for <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aifeXlnoqY" title="forgetaboutitrobert" target="_blank"><i>Chinatown</i>.</a>  Towne decides then and there to make a picture out of the novel; it takes him a while to do so.  Come 2006, voila, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5WDnF0sV5I" title="askthecritics" target="_blank"><i>Ask the Dust</i></a>.</p>
<p>I won’t comment on the performances or the diegetic structure of this <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ask_the_dust/" title="betterthanMaxPayne" target="_blank">oft-maligned</a> film.  While the reviewers cobbled cranky critiques, none cast aspersions on this piece of celluloid for any abuse of architectural accuracy.  I would, however, were I to have an appropriate forum to do so.  This being barely it, we’re off to the races.  </p>
<p>Towne beat his brains out making this movie, befriending Fante, writing the script on spec (unheard of for a man of his stature), jumping through every archetypally ugly financing hoop and unearthing some undiscovered ones in the process.  But yes, this labor of love paid off, because I was there opening day, ignoring the performances and diegetic structure to sit gape-mouthed at—what else?  Bunker Hill.  And sit in wonder and disbelief I did, mostly at the sheer strange world into which I’d been injected:   Bunker Hill was dementedly askew.  Therefore <i>I</i> was dementedly askew.  Well, Mr. D.A., I hear you say, if you’re so All That, <i>you</i> try to make period picture.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3029/2962379545_c5d14637c4_o.gif" alt="TreasureIsland" align="right" height="367" width="250">I may only know the bare minimum about making period pictures, but at least it’s something.  Ten years ago, Richard and I—Kim’s Richard, builder of this blog—were the art department for “indie”&#157; film <a href="http://www.kingpix.com/films/ti/production/" title="anislandofDoom" target="_blank"><i>Treasure Island</i></a>.   <i>Treasure Island</i> was shot on film and set in 1945—and who on earth has ever made a serious period feature with no budget?  We built sets in a makeshift soundstage, shot at locations with cajoled props in a manner that would make Ed Wood blush, and shut down City streets (necessary when staging a riot).    That’s how you make a big, sprawling period picture (which went on to win the top honors at Sundance, the “Special Jury Prize for Distinctive Vision in Filmaking,”&#157; aka the coveted “What the Hell was <i>That</i>?! Award”&#157;) for less than the latte budget of <i>Beverly Hills Chihuahua</i>:  make sure you have neither money nor expertise.  But I’m not here to impugn the excesses of studio excrescence.  I’m just pointing out that we did more with less.  We were <i>historically accurate</i>.  To an annoying degree. </p>
<p><i>Ask the Dust</i>, less so.  Oh, it looks great, but it’s Bunker Hill Bizarro.  Batman once pointed out to the Mystery gang that the Joker did first-rate counterfeiting, save for one thing:  President Lincoln never wore a turtleneck sweater.  Suffice it to say, Bunker Hill’s neck will never get cold.</p>
<p>Consider.  Towne was in development on this project for thirty years.  During that time he could have learned the difference between the Second and Third Street tunnels.  Or spent an hour finding someone who did.  Look, no-one is here to talk smack about <i>Ask the Dust</i> Production Designer <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D___SxnnW0&amp;feature=related" title="HP" target="_blank">Dennis Gassner</a>. Many have gone into production design to <i>be</i> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNspFSUv0nM" title="BFF" target="_blank">Dennis Gassner</a>.  And the production looks terrific—but there are those among us will forever be at a loss to understand what the hell it was that Towne/Gassner &amp; his team/whoever’s responsible was <i>doing</i>.  </p>
<p><i><br>
Ask the Dust</i>—it’s not that it’s full of rampant anachronism (if <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCfflhAHbT0" title="ouch" target="_blank"><i>The Sting</i></a> is set in the 30s, why are they listening to 1890s Scott Joplin, and have 1970s hair?), nor does it feel just altogether wrong &amp; parachronistic (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xHwXleX9w0" title="doubleouch" target="_blank"><i>Ha! Ha! Harlem Nights!</i></a>)—no, it’s anatopistic, which is a ten-dollar word meaning strange as all get out.  Instead of mere chronological anomaly, we have full-bore objet-out-of-place, for example, a tunnel that’s moved over.  (I’m just talking about the giant corporeal set they built.  The actual CGI they dropped on top of it is a monument to chronological anomaly.  We’ll get to that.)</p>
<p>Let’s talk tunnels.  The designers read the script, and it says Angels Flight, Third Street.  Ok.  Art Department gets to work.  Now then:</p>
<p>This is the Third Street tunnel:<br>
<img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3211/2959012656_cb48c9195e_o.gif" alt="TSS" height="329" width="575"></p>
<p>This is the Second Street tunnel:<br>
<img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3198/2962466919_e92c6c2953_o.gif" alt="SST" height="264" width="575"></p>
<p>This is what they elected to build:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3024/2962785174_9787fd5208_o.gif" alt="SST2000" height="356" width="575"><br>
Hence:<br>
<img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3050/2961816749_7538d4242b_o.gif" alt="FancifulBH" height="412" width="575"></p>
<p>Got it?  It’s the Second Street tunnel with Angels Flight next to it.  And other Third Street whatnot atop.  Some of it, anyhow.</p>
<p>This is no mere clickety-clack of computer, or making of matte painting (do people still do those?), this was <i>built</i>:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3217/2961815619_5696c9d6f3_o.gif" alt="tunnelofyore" height="204" width="400"></p>
<p>1924 looked just like 2004&#8230;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3232/2961937633_33ef85f81a_o.gif" alt="sstunderconstruction" height="327" width="575"></p>
<p>Yes, I find this peternaturally exciting, but then, I need to get out more.  In any event:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3050/2961816749_0a7267d6fd_m.jpg" alt="fancifulsmaller" align="left" height="172" width="240"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s again turn our attention to <i>AtD</i>&#8216;s  world of Third and Hill, 1933.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3279/2961816441_00473c55ab_o.gif" alt="3HCrock" height="448" width="400"></p>
<p>Here then is your standard pre-June 1908 <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/crocker_mansion" title="theCrock" target="_blank">Crocker Mansion</a> shot.  There’s the Crock, the observation tower, no Elks gate of course.  Down from the Crocker there’s the Nelson House and the Ferguson house.  On the east side of the street, in descending order, the Hillcrest, the Sunshine Apartments, the McCoy House, and the St. Helena Sanitarium.  </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3039/2961816267_31131c5570_o.gif" alt="elksahoy" align="right" height="409" width="294">What I find really intriguing in <i>Ask the Dust</i>’s interpretation is the inclusion of the six-bay arched entry to Angels Flight, up top on Olive Street (you can see four of the open bays because the two on the left were closed in for the ticket booth).  This pavilion would naturally butt up against the Hillcrest, but because the tunnel below is now so <i>wide</i>, there exists this odd <i>empty</i> area.  The six-bay pavilion up top also thrusts us into an all the more peculiar place within the time-space continuum; it only existed between 1910 and 1914.  While the Crocker Mansion existed before 1908.  And the here-absent Observation Tower was not removed until 1938, five years after the <i>Ask the Dust</i> shot was “taken.”&#157;</p>
<p>So why use the Second Street tunnel and not the Third?  I have a possible explanation for this.  Here is a passage from the book:</p>
<div align="justify">
<i>I took the steps down Angel’s Flight to Hill Street:  a hundred and forty steps, with tight fists, frightened of no man, but scared of the Third Street Tunnel, scared to walk through it—claustrophobia. </i>
</div>
<p>So there you have it.  They <i>couldn’t</i> build the Third Street tunnel because Bandini’s character was scared of…so they built the…OK, so there was a time when everyone was <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YB2lrrOJgg&amp;feature=related" title="1942thesequel" target="_blank">coked out of their skulls </a>and something like that could have occured. But nowadays there’s oversight, and bottom lines, and so on.  Right?</p>
<p>But go back to the <i>Ask the Dust</i> image.  The (pre-1933) Ferguson home  down on the street by Angels Flight is sort of correct, though its gable faced at an angle to the street.  And where is the entry arch to Angels Flight, pre-1910 or post?  The buildings on the other side of the street are entirely fanciful…vaguely correct in their massing, but that’s about it.  The Hillcrest never had bay windows.  The McCoy house wasn’t double gabled—and the Sunshine Apts are gone, presumably so that the Sanitarium could be shoved up the hill.  </p>
<p>In theory Gassner made a conscious aesthetic decision to go with the Crocker because it played better visually.  Or there was an unpaid intern who saw a stack of postcards and slapped this together.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3287/2961938259_0d84fc5c05_o.gif" alt="whatthe" height="311" width="575"><br>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Someone apparently saw an image of the Bath Block, once on the SW corner of Fifth and Hill.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3188/2962664538_4e13bf5579_o.gif" alt="walkin" height="309" width="575"></p>
<p>It doesn’t seem to bother Bandini much that he lives in a counterfactual alternate time universe.  (Also, the Confederacy won, and because of that we have gills.  Perhaps, rather than being doomed to an episode of <i>Sliders</i>, Bandini’s existence in this new world of speculative fiction where the Crocker survives is more akin to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delenda_Est" title="DE" target="_blank"><i>Delenda Est</i></a>, and isn’t, therefore, you know, that bad?)<br>
<img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3219/2961819431_a1476f2006_o.gif" alt="cominhome" height="322" width="575"><br>

The Alta Loma slopes down to Hill Street, in the middle of the 300 block—to the right of the St. Paul neon.</p>
<p>Back in the day, in the 300 block, that St. Paul Hotel was the site of the Western Mutual Life Bldng, the Alta Loma where the Hotel Columbia stood.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3193/2961936949_08a4913244.jpg" alt="lookdownthird" height="361" width="500"></p>
<p>A shot from the Graf:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3002/2962783788_b7bb7f3c09_o.gif" alt="viewfromthegrafzep" height="336" width="575"></p>
<p>The entrance to the tunnel is on the right; the Alta Loma, bottom center.</p>
<p>Let us note too that while they built this:   <br>
<img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3002/2962784708_8eda531e0a_o.gif" alt="gatesofhell" height="430" width="575"></p>
<p>

<p>It gets barely a nod in the film.  (Probably because while they constructed a working PE Red Car that got lots of camera time, there were no Olivet or Sinai.)  Nevertheless, it’s all the more effective when we’re not hit over the head with the thing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don’t even want to discuss the unexplainable “flying in”&#157; opening credits—which, of course, is exactly what I’m going to do.  So we’re flying in, and Bunker Hill has all of, oh, nine structures, and Bandini’s Alta Loma on Third is one of them, which we recognize as 512 West Second Street, once just above the Second Street tunnel:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3165/2961820227_986f8535ac_o.gif" alt="flyingin1" height="404" width="575"></p>

<p>I could go on and on (haven’t even deconstructed Third Street) but think I’ve made my point:  <i>weird</i>, and enjoyably so.  It’s not that the sets were treif out of lack of effort.  They had the opportunity to rebuild Bunker Hill from the Ground Up, something never attempted before and will likely never happen again (until I’m given thirty-six acres and a drunken bank president), and I commend them for doing most impressive work:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3070/2961938813_472f2a3673_o.gif" alt="impressive" height="430" width="575"></p>
<p>(The first rule of any period LA picture:  when in doubt, stick City Hall in there.)</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3157/2961819887_5cab5e1732_o.gif" alt="hello" height="319" width="575"></p>

Yes, impressive, impressive work.  Now consider, if all had been perfect, what would I have had to write about?</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3066/2961936707_a17929e50f_o.gif" alt="fromthefutureguy" align="left" height="500" width="260"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I should point out as well that the costuming was first-rate (Albert Wolsky won the Oscar for <i><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bs296PVx01E" title="notBugsyMalone" target="_blank">Bugsy</a></i>).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bet when you got up this morning you weren’t wondering whether you’d see Arturo Bandini with his Discman today.</p>

<p>Speaking of CGI, what&#8217;s next on deck?  Again starring our City Hall,  CGI removing modernity like debridement.<img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3184/2961936323_5b97fa17d8_o.gif" alt="changy" height="257" width="575"><br>

<p>I get so tired of hearing about you can’t shoot old LA because there’s <a href="http://www.mcnblogs.com/mcindie/archives/2006/03/townes_la_dust.html#comments" title="baboonfury" target="_blank">no old LA left in which to shoot</a> (yes, I know they’re not actually just sloppy and lazy; it’s just a disingenuous way to get around verbalizing that it’s cheaper to shoot in fill-in-the-blank).  But give me a camera and some crazy people and twelve dollars I’ll make you the best damn Bunker Hill movie yet.  </p>

<p>Of all the dearly departed Bunker Hill mansions, the <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/castle">Castle</a> and <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/salt_box">Salt Box</a> are probably the best known. The two houses which resided at 325 &amp; 339 South Bunker Hill Avenue were spared the wrecking ball, declared Historic Cultural Monuments, and posed for numerous photos before being moved to Heritage Square (and were subsequently burned to the ground by vandals). Rarely mentioned is the house that stood between its two more famous neighbors at 333 South Bunker Hill Avenue.</p>

<p>
As <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/salt_box">discussed previously,</a> the Castle, Salt Box, and 333 S. Bunker Hill were possibly all built in 1888 by Rueben M. Baker who lived in the Castle and either sold or leased the other two structures. The mansion had various occupants until it was purchased by Spencer Roan Thorpe in 1901.Â  </p>

<p>
Thorpe was a Kentucky native and descendent of Patrick Henry which gained him easy admission into the Sons of the Revolution and Colonial Wars. He served as a Confederate captain during the Civil War and was wounded three times before being captured by the Yanks and imprisoned on Johnson&#8217;s Island. Thorpe survived the War and made his fortune as a lawyer in Louisiana before making his way to Los Angeles in 1883. He purchased plots of land throughout the city, as well as a 150 acre walnut orchard in Ventura County. Thorpe also reportedly started the first settlement in what became the city of Gardena. He also served two terms on the Board of Police Commissioners of Los Angeles. When he moved into 333 South Bunker Hill Avenue, Thorpe was accompanied by his wife, Helena, and their five children. </p>

Helena Thorpe hosted many social events at the Bunker Hill home, including a wedding breakfast for her daughter following early morning nuptials at St. Vibiana&#8217;s Cathedral in May 1905. Close friends and family would be reunited a mere four months later for Spencer Thorpe&#8217;s funeral.</p>

On the morning of September 2, 1905, Thorpe left one of his ranch homes to travel out to Simi Valley and Moorpark. When his horse and carriage returned home alone, search parties were sent out and Thorpe&#8217;s body was found on the side of a road. There were no signs of foul play and it was presumed that he died of heart failure. His body was brought back to the Bunker Hill family residence and a small service was held at St. Vibiana&#8217;s. The surviving members of the Thorpe family lived in the Bunker Hill house for another year before selling it to an H.N. Green for $20,000 (a little under half a million in today&#8217;s dollars).</p>

Like many of the homes on the Hill, the house was soon divided, and accommodated three households. By 1920, the mansion had been further divided into twelve residences, most of which were occupied by single boarders in single rooms. 333 South Bunker Hill Avenue saw some action in 1917 when Olive H. Faulk fell out of her second story window. Moments before her plunge, she had been cutting ham when her abusive husband, Irvin, pushed her into a corner and ordered her to pack her trunk and move. Apparently, he did not mean it, for when Olive tried to walk out the door, he locked and blocked it. Olive opted for the window, survived the fall, and filed for divorce. The L.A. Times astutely observed that the incident “ended their conjugal relations.”&#157; </p>

<p>The mansion at 333 South Bunker Hill Avenue survived into the 1960s with little incident. When the time came for the neighborhood to go, the houses on either side of 333 were selected to survive as monuments to a bygone era, and the mansion in the middle was slated for demolition. By 1967, the house at 333 South Bunker Hill was gone. </p>

		<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3152/2942950281_bf70e30fa4_m.jpg" alt="burningbush1" align="left" width="240" height="230">When the residents of Bunker Hill discovered that the Alameda Street crib district prostitutes were living in their neighborhood, they drafted polite letters to the City Council and the Police Commission complaining about it.</p>
<p>But when they discovered that a rowdy religious sect called the Burning Bush had set up its headquarters on Olive Street, they called the police straightaway.Â  Scarlet women were one thing, but cult leaders quite another.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3277/2942950367_8669c13a46_m.jpg" alt="burningbush2" align="right" width="146" height="240">Based out of Denver, leaders of the Burning Bush flock came to Los Angeles in the spring of 1904, and wasted no time in luring converts.Â  In addition to their base of operations near Angel&#8217;s Flight at 315 Olive Street, they also established a revival tent at the corner of Spring and Seventh.Â  At meetings, their followers would regularly shout, leap up and down, speak in tongues, and fall into semi-catatonic states for hours at a time.Â  So enthusiastic were their cries that neighbors claimed they drowned out the sound of the streetcar as it rattled up the hill.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3002/2942950493_e9e705a07f.jpg" alt="burningbush3" align="left" width="227" height="500">Despite the leaping, members of the Burning Bush were not to be confused with the Holy Jumpers, another evangelical sect that had come to Los Angeles around the same time.Â  Though they operated on a similar set of beliefs, the Burning Bush was generally considered to be less objectionable than the Holy Jumpers because they were not quite so loud.Â  Additionally, while the Burning Bush had culled its leaders from respectable cities like Denver and Boston, the Holy Jumpers were from Alabama (gasp).</p>
<p>While the Burning Bush&#8217;s evangelical fervor made them strange in the eyes of their neighbors, it didn&#8217;t make them a cult.Â  What made them a cult was their practice of quickly separating initiates from all their money, real estate, and worldly possessions.</p>
<p>In 1906, a deaf man named Lorenzo Dunlap sued Burning Bush leader Charles Bryant to recover approximately $1000 worth of cash and property he&#8217;d signed over the cult with the agreement that they would hold the property in trust and care for him until he died.Â  He&#8217;d feared that his own family members would try to have him committed to an asylum and swipe the estate for themselves.</p>
<p>But instead, the Bryants did.Â  Dunlap claimed that once the money had changed hands, he found the Bryants cold and unwilling to support him.Â  Additionally, they promptly sold Dunlap&#8217;s property in North Dakota at a tidy profit and used the money to buy themselves a fine Los Angeles area home and a cow.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t just property they took.Â  In 1905, a Mr. Vitagliano sent police to the Burning Bush house on Olive to find his 16-year-old daughter, Annie.Â  Vitagliano said that the Burning Bush had torn his family apart, sending his wife off to Europe to do missionary work, turning his daughter against him, and constantly pestering him for money.</p>
<p>One of the saddest Burning Bush casualties was a Mrs. Elizabeth Northcutt, who was committed to the State Hospital for the Insane at Patton in 1908, after years tangled up with the Burning Bush and another group, the Pillar of Fire.Â  Northcutt&#8217;s husband, a butcher, had exhausted all of his resources trying to nurse her back to health, even after she had emptied his bank account and abandoned him and their son for the Burning Bush, before finally returning home, frail and raving.</p>
<p>At her insanity hearing, Northcutt flew into a rage against his wife&#8217;s father, the wealthy James Murdoch, saying, &quot;You ought to be ashamed of yourself for letting them send your only child to a public asylum when you are amply able to provide for her comfort.&quot;</p>
<p>Murdoch coldly replied, &quot;She is your wife and it is your duty to support her.Â  I have done much for her in the past.Â  I have had financial losses and have large expenses of my own.Â  I see no reason why the State should not care for her.&quot;</p>
<p>The examining physicians reported that &quot;previous to &#8216;getting religion,&#8217; Mrs. Northcutt was plump and merry.Â  In two years, she has become a nervous wreck.&quot;Â  However, they expected she would recover her senses in time.</p>

<p>The powers that be decided that Bunker Hill was an eyesore and an impediment to the development of downtown Los Angeles, and the case was slowly created that the neighborhood was on the decline very quickly and the best thing to do would be the remove it.  It was in this era that the CRA (Community Redevelopment Agency) was created to deal with the city&#8217;s chore of rehabilitating Bunker Hill.  The breadth and scope of this agency&#8217;s early history and Bunker Hill (inextricably intertwined) is beyond the scale of this post, but future ones will begin to address it.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;This entry by Yukio, &lt;a href="http://ia310816.us.archive.org/1/items/yukiokarawataniBunkerHillHistoryPart3/Bunker192045.pdf" title="1920-44"&gt;The Evolution of Bunker Hill&amp;#8212;Part Three&lt;/a&gt;, simply creates the stereotype of a blighted neighborhood, which would become its self-fulfilling prophecy.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be noted in reference to the article&amp;#8217;s mention of the Hill&amp;#8217;s much appreciated housing during WWII, that it was considered the safest place in the city for single women to live.&lt;/p&gt;

Maybe it’s the big spooky tower.  Maybe it’s the Nugent’s corner site at Third Street and Grand Avenue&#8230;<i>3rd &amp; Grand</i> just purrs off the tongue, which only seems to further imbue that location with the status as Ground Zero, Bunker Hill.   </p>
<p>But truth be told, the Nugent was never a hotbed of vice, should you be perusing our <i>OBH</i> blog to sate your currish needs.  Heck, a 1905 article about the original <a href="http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;id=8h7yZGEsFmEC&amp;dq=%22white+ribboners%22&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=wdr3H-8lms&amp;sig=YlZoLUpeet5PPn2U7PqJKgoolfU&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ct=result#PPA2,M1" title="WCTYou" target="_blank">White Ribboners</a> who fought demon drink back in the early ‘70s mentions that crusading Quaker Josephine Marlatt chose the newly-opened Nugent as her home.</p>

Dean.  It was March 10, 1935, and Dean was busy plying his honest trade out in Pomona at a railroad right of way while a train crew was switching freight cars in the local yards.  Then some woman, as high and as mighty as they come, decided to drive her automobile across said railroad right of way; this enraged Dean, who pitched his lantern through her car windshield.  Unfortunately the woman was Mrs. Lois Browning, wife of Desk Sergeant Browning of the local police force, which might give some insight into her high-and-mightiness.</p>

I must admit, my inclusion of the Nugent (which became the New Grand some time in the 1940s, to be pulled down in the mid-1960s by the CRA, naturally, <i>ad victoriam</i>) is due in larg<img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3171/2932814347_9e7d6d3f3c_o.gif" alt="1961" align="right" height="41" width="344">e part to the wonderful color image I am fortunate enough to here include.</p>

<p>One does have to wonder as to whether the two-story Corinthian columns were always broken up by those fire escapes.  </p>

<p>With the New Grand gone, the 1970s and 80s thrilled to this hole in the ground.  (Here, we are facing the other way down Grand from the image above.)  At left, the 1982 Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill Crocker Tower II and at right, the 1973 AC Martin Security Pacific National Bank Plaza tower, butting up against Third (the road in the foreground would becomeÂ   Thaddeus Kosciusko).Â  Then West-LA Nadel Architects (who are at present in charge of designing two thirty-story towers at Third &amp; Beaudry) showed up in 1988 and said <i>here</i>:</p>

The surprise was that he was galvanized into action.

Pompey and his mistress, Mrs. Mitalzo, were out for a stroll on <street w:st="on"><address w:st="on">South Bunker Hill Avenue</address></street>. The dog became increasingly agitated as they drew nearer to a rooming house just up the block. A few doors away from the building, Pompey began to growl. When his hair stood up on end,Â Mrs. MitalzoÂ bent over to try to soothe him. She had relaxed her grip on Pompey’s leash for only a moment, and it was then that Pompey broke free. He ran up the steps of the building, and into the apartment of Mr. William A. Stark.
</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
The 24 year old Stark had just been discharged from his job as an elevator operator at a downtown hotel. Management had told him that he was through because he didn’t close the elevator doors properly. The despondent man had taken several newspapers and fashioned them into a long cone. He placed the small end of the improvised suicide device over a gas jet in his room, and he placed the large end over his face. Stark then turned on the gas and lay down to die.
</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
When Pompey entered the room, Stark was unconscious and near death. The valiant dog dragged the motionless Stark into the safety of the hallway. Mrs. Mitalzo ran into the rooming house to search for Pompey and discovered him watching over the dying man.
</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
Police were summoned and Stark was taken to the <place w:st="on"><placename w:st="on">Receiving</placename> <placetype w:st="on">Hospital</placetype></place>, where he was revived. Pompey stayed around long enough to see the ambulance pull away. Apparently satisfied with the outcome, the dog rejoined his mistress and the two continued their stroll.

Pompey vanished from the pages of the Los Angeles Times after his brief moment in the limelight, but his famed counterpart, Rin-Tin-Tin, was just beginning his film career in 1923.<img loading="lazy" border="0" align="right" width="330" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3069/2924364067_e0750ee01b_o.jpg" alt="rintyradio" height="269">

Rin-Tin-Tin was only five days old when he was rescued from a bombed out kennel in <country-region w:st="on"><place w:st="on">France</place></country-region>. WWI was drawing to a close when a <country-region w:st="on"><place w:st="on">U.S.</place></country-region> solider, Lee Duncan, spotted the kennel and decided to investigate.

Rin-Tin-Tin (aka Rinty) was seen performing in a local dog show by movie producer Charles Jones – and a star was born. Rinty worked hard and would often relax by listening to the radio.

His career lasted for over a decade and eventually earned him a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Rinty passed away quietly in his sleep at the ripe old age of 14.

<p>When <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/castle">the Castle</a> and <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/salt_box">Salt Box</a> were physically moved from Bunker Hill to Heritage Square in Highland Park, it was probably a sight most residents had never seen. However, this was not the first time a home on the Hill was relocated. Almira Hershey outdid them all in the early 1900s by not only moving her Bunker Hill home, but by also splitting it in half and transforming it into a massive and majestic apartment building.<br>
<!--break--><br>
<br>
Almira Hershey, better known as Mira, is a name that was once prominent in Los Angeles, but is now pretty much (and unfortunately) forgotten. She was a relative of Milton S. Hershey, founder of the Pennsylvania chocolate empire, and the daughter of Benjamin Hershey who amassed a fortune in the lumber and banking industries. Mira inherited a substantial sum when her father died and she relocated from Muscatine, Iowa to Los Angeles in the 1890s.</p>
<p>Hershey purchased real estate on Bunker Hill and commenced construction on a number of residences, including her own home at the NE corner of Fourth and Grand Avenue in 1896. The elegant structure sat across the street from the Rose Residence, and cost $5,000 to build (around $123,000 in today&#8217;s dollars).</p>
<div style="text-align: center">
<img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3163/2920248831_8eba013f1e.jpg?v=0" height="102" width="317">
</div>
<p>After living at 350 South Grand for ten years, Hershey decided she needed a change. Instead of merely redecorating, she physically had the house moved to 750 W. Fourth Street and commissioned architectsÂ  C.F. Skilling and Otto H. Neher to split the residence in half and turn it into an apartment building. The renovations on the new building were completed in December of 1907 and the finished product included one and three bedroom suites complete with patented wall beds, artistic wall decorations, and interior wood finishings. Because of the structure&#8217;s resemblance to a European castle, Hershey&#8217;s new apartment building was christened the Castle Towers.</p>
<div style="text-align: center">
<img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3285/2921093320_713617551b.jpg?v=0" width="400">
</div>
<p>
As for the prime lot on the corner of Fourth and Grand, Hershey had plans to build a hotel on the location of her former residence, and again hired Skilling &amp; Neher. The concrete foundation had been laid by March of 1908, but plans were halted a couple of weeks later when the architects filed a lawsuit against Hershey for nonpayment of fees. The hotel was never completed, and the concrete foundation was turned into a parking lot that would remain until the neighborhood was completely redeveloped in the 1960s.</p>
<div style="text-align: center">

</div>
<p>
Mira Hershey did go on build her hotel called the Hershey Arms on Wilshire Boulevard. She also fell in love with the famed (and former) Hollywood Hotel, which she purchased and lived in until her death in 1930. She was so enamored with the building at the corner of Hollywood and Highland that she commissioned a replica, the Naples Hotel, be constructed in a Long Beach neighborhood.</p>

<p>
Mira Hershey was always quick to share her wealth, but kept her philanthropic activities private after the Los Angeles Times attacked her for donating money for a hospital to be built in her hometown of Muscatine, Iowa instead of her current home city. One of Hershey&#8217;s most significant donations came after she died and her will revealed that she left $300,000 to UCLA for the construction of the school&#8217;s first on-campus dormitory. Countless students would call Hershey Hall home for decades.</p>

Golly, I cain’t never remember, is the Dome right kitty-corner to the Melrose?  Weren’t there the Richelieu ‘tween ‘um?  I kin hardly recall.  Reckon there ought to be a <u>map</u>.  </i></p>
<p>Reader, we hear this sort of comment often, though we are yet to understand why it is forever posed Ã  la Opie Taylor.  That notwithstanding, it is a reasonable query, and rest assured we are working on a map of Bunker Hill, replete with requisite names and addresses and footprints, and in a perfect world, will also include neat stuff like topographies, chronologically morphing blocks, and rollover, uh, hyperlinks.  While I cannot promise all or any of the futuristic ideas I believe I’ve heard bandied about, it should definitely have pretty colors, and by the next time you go to MOCA, you’ll be able to call up the map on your PocketEniac™ and say “ah yes, we’re just now on the site of the (<i>tap tap tap</i>) Lovejoy Apartments.”&#157;</p>
<p>Until such time, let me offer you <i>this</i> map.  It has none of the aforementioned geegaws, save for the pretty colors, and only comes in one year:  1921.  Behold, Baist’s Real Estate Atlas of Surveys of Los Angeles.  You may have heard of the Baist’s map; you can get a good look at it <a href="http://www.historicmapworks.com/Atlas/US/7441/" title="Baists21" target="_blank">here</a>  (and their 1910 outing <a href="http://www.historicmapworks.com/Atlas/US/7446/" title="Baists010" target="_blank">here</a>).  Plat Seven is the one to click for Bunker Hill.  I suggest you head down to Central Library in a couple weeks and take a gander at an <a href="http://www.lapl.org/events/unfolded/index.html" title="laplbaists" target="_blank">in-the-flesh</a> Baist’s.

<p>Let&#8217;s look at something up close.  Something we can really sink our teeth into.</p>

<p>Now we&#8217;re cooking with gas.  Above, Hope, Grand and Olive run north.

<p>Alright, off somewhere else:</p>

<p>Between Second and Third; I&#8217;ve typed in street names up top to keep y&#8217;all oriented (that&#8217;s Bunker Hill Avenue between Hope and Grand).

<p>I want to add that the footprints of the buildings are not Sanborn-quality; do not take them as gospel.  And at 321 S. Olive, that&#8217;s the Ems, not the Elms.  So, ok, not everyone at Baist&#8217;s was as exacting as a Sanborner.  Nevertheless, gaze here upon the glory of the <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/hotelnorthern" title="onlyanorthernhotel" target="_blank">Northern</a>!  <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/221_Olive" title="221" target="_blank">Places</a> of <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/doorbusters" title="whoyougonnacall" target="_blank">unusual</a> <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/lewisthelight" title="ltl" target="_blank">unusualness</a>!

<p>In 1921, we still had 411 and 409 standing on West First, though the Hotel Locke is gone&#8230;and if you&#8217;re wondering what it is I&#8217;m talking about, you can always consult the egregiously over-detalied mapping on the subject in <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/TheDirtPatchofSecondandHill" title="DPtime" target="_blank">this</a> post, and <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/HillStBlockRoundup" title="roundemup" target="_blank">this</a>.    And notice how 425 was called the Rio Grande.  There&#8217;re our old pals the <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/richelieu" title="Richandtasty" target="_blank">Richelieu</a>, <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/taxonomy_menu/6/86" title="MelrosePlaces" target="_blank">Melrose</a>, <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/node/174" title="wherethesockscomefrom" target="_blank">Argyle</a> and <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/TheMooreCliff" title="MCMC" target="_blank">Moore Cliff</a>.</p>
<p>Well, you get the idea.  As we cast our light on bulldozed hills and fallen homes (and as you get to know the forgotten folk whose culture was so different, but whose attitudes were so similar to yours) perhaps when you dream of Bunker Hill, you&#8217;ll be able to traverse the grand avenues (and dart down the alleyways) with surety.  Because as much as we&#8217;d like to rebuild Bunker Hill on some empty acreage, we had too much self-respect to get one of those &quot;Everyone Deserves Everything&quot; loans so popular until recently.  We may have to content ourselves with designing a 3D tactical shooter, with HLSL and dynamic tonemapping.  Again, until such time, we have this map.</p>

		<p>They called it the red light district, the tenderloin, Little Paree, Hell&#8217;s Half Acre, and my favorite, the crib district.</p>
<p>From the late 1800s until the turn of the century, prostitution in Los Angeles was more or less legal, and centered in a district that included Alameda, New High, Main, and a few other streets in the area east of Bunker Hill.Â  Most of the classier parlor houses that catered to wealthy and well-connected Angelenos were located on New High Street, including the one belonging to Los Angeles&#8217;s first storied madam, Pearl Morton.Â  The brothels on Main Street were more modest, mostly rooming houses.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3234/2904106382_ffb1efa2fc_o.jpg" alt="cribs" align="left" width="245" height="188">However, the most notorious eyesores were the single-story, ramshackle cribs on Alameda, long rows of narrow rooms that prostitutes could rent by the night, at exorbitant rates, designated here on the Sanborn maps as &quot;female boarding.&quot;Â  The Alameda cribs were visible from the nearby Southern Pacific line, and rail passengers on their way to Los Angeles would gawk out the windows at prostitutes soliciting business from the sidewalks.</p>
<p>The prevailing line of thought among civil leaders and Los Angeles&#8217;s many, many police chiefs during this period was that prostitution was a social evil that could not be eradicated, but could be contained and regulated.Â  Better to have vice located within a few city blocks rather than scattered throughout the city where it would be impossible to police.</p>
<p>Los Angeles residents, however, felt differently about it.Â  In a June 1895 article, the <i>Times</i> reported that Police Chief John Glass had received numerous complaints from Bunker Hill residents complaining of the crib district&#8217;s proximity to their tony neighborhood.</p>
<p>And since the prostitutes were making fairly good money, and since crib living was both expensive and unpleasant, many prostitutes managed to pay the rent on their cribs and also rented lodging in nearby Bunker Hill hotels and rooming houses. </p>
<p>Due to its proximity, Bunker Hill would serve as a staging ground for the movement in the early 1900s to clear out the crib district.Â  The social purity crusaders included the Reverends Wiley J. Phillips and Sidney Kendall, as well as Friday Morning Club founder Caroline Severance.</p>
<p>In 1903, about 200 Angelenos met at the First Congregational Church at Hill and Third to discuss building a halfway house for prostitutes who wished to reform.Â  The facility, called the Door of Hope, opened on Daly Street in East Los Angeles later that year, around the same time that the movement was successful in getting the Alameda Street cribs shut down.</p>
<p>That mission accomplished, the social purity crusaders turned their attention to the parlor houses, a tougher nut to crack, partly because they kept a lower profile, and partly because they counted no small number of politicians, attorneys, and other civic leaders among their clientele.</p>
<p>The crusaders put these houses, including Morton&#8217;s at 327 1/2 New High Street, the Antlers Club, Stella Mitchell&#8217;s, and Viola&#8217;s Place, under surveillance, and pestered the Mayor and Police Commission until finally winning a small victory.Â  At the end of March 1904, the parlor houses would be shuttered.Â  Almost all of them went along with the ordinance, and the <i>Times</i> reported that &quot;the keepers of dives did not wait for the police to call, but quietly folded their tents and departed.&quot;</p>
<p>All but one.Â  All but one that had been operating right on Bunker Hill, not a block away from the First Congregational Church.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3291/2904106434_ff5433a41c_o.jpg" alt="parlorhouse" align="right" width="320" height="297">On March 31, 1904, police raided an establishment at 355 South Hill Street, operated by Ethel Wood.Â  She was arrested along with three women, Mabel Stone, Dolly Long, and Hattie Jones.Â  TheÂ  four appeared in court the next day, all wearing long black veils to frustrate the looky-loos.</p>
<p>Wood was fined $100 for selling beer without a license, and the three women were &quot;vagged,&quot; or charged with vagrancy, the usual charge for prostitutes until the charge of &quot;offering&quot; came into use in the 1920s.</p>
<p>After the raid, the other parlor houses reopened quietly, and would remain open for another four years.Â  Pearl Morton, famed for her lavish parlor with two Steinway pianos, as well as her hourglass figure, flamboyant style, and hennaed hair, would be shut down in 1908, and move north to re-establish her operation in San Francisco.</p>
<p>The last quasi-legal parlor houses would close down in 1909, in tandem with the recall and subsequent resignation of Mayor Arthur Harper, a frequent brothel client.</p>
<p>And after that, prostitution did exactly what city leaders in favor of a containment strategy had predicted all along.Â  It scattered throughout the city and into residential neighborhoods, before falling under the jurisdiction of organized crime in the 1920s.</p>
