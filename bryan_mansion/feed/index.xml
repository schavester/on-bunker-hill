I thought it a shame there wasnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t an image of the Fleur-de-Lis/Capitol Hotel that replaced the Bryan, so I dug one up in the USC Archives.  Notice the &lt;a href=&quot;/brunson_mansion&quot; title=&quot;Brunson&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Brunson&lt;/a&gt; in the foreground.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This shot ca. 1910, obviously taken atop the recently-completed &lt;a href=&quot;/TheZelda&quot; title=&quot;homeoftheZeldettes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Zelda&lt;/a&gt;.  Other stuff to look atâ€”the turreted building in the distance is the Nugent, later called the New Grand.  Eventually the &lt;a href=&quot;/stottslanding&quot; title=&quot;Alto&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Alto &lt;/a&gt; would be built behind it.  Further beyond, one can just read the â€œMinnewaskaâ€ ghost-sign on the Dome (flagpole sticking up from).  One can make out the tower of the &lt;a href=&quot;/as%20well%20/brousseau_mansion&quot; title=&quot;bm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Brousseau&lt;/a&gt;, to the left.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3167/2908438515_85681d8dd4_o.gif&quot; alt=&quot;map&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; height=&quot;491&quot; width=&quot;575&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&#160;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The Fleur de Lis here is not to be confused with the establishment run by Pierce Patchett.  (Rather, please note that the &lt;i&gt;Fleur de Lis&lt;/i&gt; in becoming the &lt;i&gt;Capitol&lt;/i&gt;, signified the ascendancy of the Merovingians from mere occultic into real power; the destruction of Bunker Hill was actually symbolic regicide.  But thatâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s another post.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And now, a map:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
...1921; FDL has undergone its name change.  The Brunson&#039;s undergone &lt;i&gt;its&lt;/i&gt; transformation into a garage.
&lt;/p&gt;

The Fleur de Lis here is not to be confused with the establishment run by Pierce Patchett.  (Rather, please note that the <i>Fleur de Lis</i> in becoming the <i>Capitol</i>, signified the ascendancy of the Merovingians from mere occultic into real power; the destruction of Bunker Hill was actually symbolic regicide.

					<description><![CDATA[Just wanted to thank you for creating this blog! I&#039;ve been fascinated by Bunker Hill since I was a kid in high school in the late &#039;60s reading about the destruction of the last old homes there. I&#039;m continually amazed by the stories and photos you post! Really great stuff. To think that everything that once existed there could vanish completely within the space of one lifetime is quite mind-boggling indeed...]]></description>
