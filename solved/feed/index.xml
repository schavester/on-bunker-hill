					<description><![CDATA[What a wonderful site- I love the 1947 Project!

I went to a presentation with the new head of the MIT Media Lab a year or 2 ago. The Media Lab has a whole slew of grad students working on this today.

 Interesting how there are so few new ideas.  Some people have MIT and scads of big corporate research money.  While individual inventors and science fiction authors who are ahead of their time are always forgotten and ignored.  Oh, just like Bunker Hill, in fact!
