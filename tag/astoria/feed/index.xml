</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--><!--[endif]-->The Sentous Block is best known around noirsville as where Mike Hammer cruises over to the Jalisco Hotel in <i>Kiss Me Deadly</i>; it also contained the Bamba Club, which doubles as the Round-Up in <i>Criss Cross</i>.<span>Â  </span>(Both on the Spring St. side of the Sentous; our image shows the Main St. side.)<span>Â  </span>For more than you would ever want to know about this, go <a href="https://forum.skyscraperpage.com/showthread.php?p=4852728" title="noirsville" target="_blank">here</a> <span></span>(seems like contributor Beaudry needs a girlfriend or something).

<p class="MsoNormal">
But on to Bunker Hill!
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
Ah, the Astoria.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<a href="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4065/4676076215_b9121b04fe.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4065/4676076215_b9121b04fe.jpg" alt="Astorian" height="500" width="442" /></a>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
Nothing says deep arcaded entry and red-tiled bell tower like â€œAstoriaâ€.<span>Â  </span>Yes, one can not help but marvel at the incongruity of Bunker Hill naming systems.<span>Â  </span>I wrote earlier in OBH about the red-tiled onion domed <i>Minnewaska</i>, the fairly Franco-Renaissance <i>Sherwood</i>, and while it hasnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t been explored yet, the decisively Mission-styled 1904 Mission Apartments at Second and Olive spent much of its young life known as, of course, Castle Craig.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--><!--[endif]-->Astoria, the Greek word for quail, is also the part of Queens known for being full of Greeks.Â  <span></span>That notwithstanding, at the time of its construction, <i>Astoria</i><span style="font-style: normal"> connoted the Astoria, Queens that was then the â€œHollywood of the East.â€<span>Â  </span>Plus it had been named for John Jacob Astor.<span>Â  </span>All sorts of cachet.<span>Â  </span>Perhaps the developers thought that despite the arches and fauxdobe, the rather otherwise traditional use of the bay windows prevented naming the structure something vaguely Missiony like â€œRamona Hotelâ€ or â€œPortolÃ  Apts.</span><span style="font-style: normal">â€ </span>
</p>
<p>In any event, of the Astoria much <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/theAstoria" title="lifeanddeath" target="_blank">has been said</a>.Â <br />
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--><!--[endif]-->Next to the Astoria is the 1916 Blackstone Apartments, with the nice Beaux Arts garlands uponâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t.<span>Â  </span>Not a whole lot happened there, an ex-cop caught violating the Wright Act,<span> </span>and there were some lady bootleggers; while the Widows Protective League Los Angeles Branch Council met at the Blackstone, a widow took poison and offed herself there the very same year (1929); and Ross Page, younger brother of the widely-known <a href="https://www.insroland.org/farmerpage" title="FahmaPage" target="_blank">â€œFarmerâ€ Page</a>, was busted there by the vice squad while running two bridge games and a poker game in August of â€˜25.

<p class="MsoNormal">
I will let Matt Weinstock of the <i>Times</i><span style="font-style: normal"> do the talking for me:</span>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">
<!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--><!--[endif]--><i>That din emanating from Bunker Hill these days is the relentless pounding of the jackhammers tearing down the ancient Blackstone Apartments, 244 S Olive St., next door to the top of Angelâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Flight.</i>
</p>
<div align="justify">
</div>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">
<i>Until the demolition crew went to work on it, the Blackstone was nine stories high, counting the floors from the back entrance in the alley, which was kept locked.<span>Â  </span>However, if you entered on Olive St., as most people did, you were on the third floor, and from there it was only a six story building.<span>Â  </span>I learned this many years ago in visiting a departed colleague, <a href="https://latimesblogs.latimes.com/thedailymirror/2010/04/matt-weinstock-april-25-1960.html" title="JFBA" target="_blank">J. Farrington Barrington Arrington</a>, who lived there.</i>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">
<i>And so another quaint landmark passes and now, when I go into a building on what purports to be the main floor it will really be the main floor, not the third.<span>Â  </span>Progress marches on.<br />

W. Smith, the owner of the building.  These are handsomely decorated and furnished, and will undoubtedly serve to make the Astoria popular.  </i>

<p>â€”December 17, 1905</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before Bunker Hill hit its cinematic skids, tâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />was the place of purloinery more aligned with the tony climes of Monte Carlo than El Monte:  cat-burgling jewel thieves were at <img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3076/2420296782_74d6ffbdaf_o.gif" alt="purloinery" align="left" height="173" width="284" />work!  In October of 1911, Astoria resident Mrs. W. F. Sapp returned to her room one afternoon to findâ€¦nothing amiss.  But her mother, Mrs. W. W. Loomis, of the adjoining apartment, called attention to having heard her daughter next door at her writing desk while said daughter was supposed to be absent.  They opened the locked writing deskâ€¦to beholdâ€¦<i>gasp</i>!  The chatelaine bag, lockets and bracelets and the like were gone, as was the ancestral family tin box (found later in the lavatory, a can opener found on the fifth floor above) once filled with gold watches, fobs, and diamond-set pieces, now scattered to the underworld of crooked, loupe-wearing bangle merchants.</p>
<p>But not all crimes at the Astoria were so <i>quaint</i>.<br />

Edna A. Worden lived in the Astoria.  Forty-eight, New Hampshirite, kept to herself mostly, known around the place as a woman of culture and refinement.   Kept the bookshelves of her one-bedroom in the Astoria lined with Shakespeare, Milton, Dante, Dickens, Byron, Poe, the Greek philosophers, and many a Bible.  She made a meager wage as a WPA worker, and with the monthly $30 sent to her by her ex-husband back east, made a good life for her and her twelve year-old daughter Marguerite.</p>
<p>Marguerite, a student at Belmont Junior High School who, had she made it to Monday, was to have entered a Beverly Hills school for girls.  </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2115/2419482523_d626744857_o.gif" alt="MargueriteW" align="right" height="500" width="259" />Sunday, April 4, 1937.  Little Marguerite made a habit of always coming down to the desk to borrow the Sunday paper.  This morning she did not.  A concerned John Riley, the elevator operator, put an ear to the Wordensâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> door and ascertained a low moan; he summoned Astoria manager J. E. Harrigan, who, with his trusty stepladder, peered through the transom.  After what he saw police arrived in short order and even hardened Detective Lieutenants Ledbetter, Bryan and Lopez, after kicking in the door, had to halt in their tracks at the horror that lay in wait.  </p>
<p>Edna lay sprawled over a cot in an array of splatter, her head against the floor.  Marguerite was on the bed, her head covered with a pillow, topped with a discarded brickbat, mortar glued to its sides, sticky with blood and gore. The room was cluttered, revealing a desperate struggle during their sexual assaults and skull shatterings.  Ednaâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s purse was turned inside-out, otherwise, the room was unrifledâ€”Margueriteâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s mute witness rag doll, her ivory-bound prayer book with a shiny dime atop, her freshly washed and ironed blue gingham dress on a nail above the bed.  The fates conspired to aid their attacker; on one side of the apartment was a storeroom, on the other, the apartment of old Harry Tutin, partially deaf.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3002/2418256992_758d1be89d_o.gif" alt="downolive" align="left" height="212" width="300" />The Wordens&#8217; attacker or attackers had climbed the Angels Flight stairs and forced entry through the kitchen window just below Olive Street.  Shoes were removed before climbing inâ€”traces of sock wool were removed from the plaster casts.  (The feet, size eleven.)  The assailant is almost certainly responsible for the March 2nd rape and brick-administered basal skull-smashing of <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=651+Stanford+Ave,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90021&amp;jsv=107&amp;sll=34.041405,-118.243833&amp;sspn=0.008375,0.018947&amp;layer=c&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=34.041405,-118.243704&amp;spn=0.008375,0.018947&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr&amp;cbll=34.039892,-118.243613" title="valdezmurder" target="_blank">Rose Valdez</a>, 20, attacked while her year-old baby slept in a crib by her side. <br />

Bunker Hill was blanketed by the entire homicide squad assigned to all-night duty, with four squads of regular detectives and fifty men from Metro combing the City for suspicious Black Menâ€”not exactly racial profiling, since it was a black man who ran from the scene of the attempted January 25 brick-attack on Mrs. H. W. Koll in <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=2830+Glendale+Blvd,+90039&amp;jsv=107&amp;sll=34.109868,-118.26381&amp;sspn=0.008546,0.01457&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=34.109868,-118.26381&amp;spn=0.008546,0.01457&amp;t=h&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr" title="2830" target="_blank">Monte Sano</a> <a href="https://silverlake.tribe.net/photos/c686a18c-c1aa-4d27-b9bb-d18eb879ea50" title="montedeatho" target="_blank">hospital</a>; the February 3 <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/californiapete/244927668/sizes/l/" title="barclay" target="_blank">Barclay</a> hotel room skull fracturing of Elizabeth Reis (again, leaving his brick behind); and the March 28 Zoe Damrell attack in her home at <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=1026+Ingraham+St,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90017&amp;jsv=107&amp;sll=34.055166,-118.26175&amp;sspn=0.008551,0.01457&amp;layer=c&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=34.05129,-118.262522&amp;spn=0.008551,0.01457&amp;t=h&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr&amp;cbll=34.051949,-118.262424" title="damrellattack" target="_blank">1026 Ingraham</a>, she left barely alive by a brick-bearing assailant who bore remarkable resemblance to the large black gentleman seen lurking by the Valdez house immediately before her murder.</p>
<p>Assorted Los Angeles sickosâ€”<i>alleged</i>â€”were brought in for questioning, their faces and addresses plastered throughout the papers (doubtlessly tarnishing their lives forevermore) but all were cleared, not only through their alibis, but because the Worden killer had the bad fortune of leaving something else behind besides his brickbat:  before putting on his gloves, he moved a milk bottle.  Fingerprint central.  </p>
<p>So if the killer skipped town, thereâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s a good chance he could have, would have never been caught.  But a certain Robert Nixon just had to kill women.  With bricks.  This time in Chicago, on May 28, 1938, the nineteen year-old Nixon brickâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />d Mrs. Florence Johnson, wife of a Chicago city fireman, and gets popped for it, and confesses.  A little digging revealed that during the time of the Worden and Valdez killings, he lived at <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=803+S+Central+Ave,+90021&amp;jsv=107&amp;sll=34.033528,-118.243339&amp;sspn=0.008553,0.01457&amp;layer=c&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=34.034951,-118.243339&amp;spn=0.008553,0.01457&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr&amp;cbll=34.033518,-118.243315" title="nixonsplace" target="_blank">803 South Central Avenue</a>.  </p>
<p>Nixon initially denied involvement with the crimes, but after LA Police Chief Davis announced that comparison of fingerprints made positive identification of Nixon, Nixon admitted to the whole brick-laden shebangâ€”the Wordens and Valdez, plus the Chicago murders of Mrs. Florence Thompson Castle in her hotel room in 1936, and the rape/murder of student nurse Anna Kuchta in August 1937, and assaults on at least seventeen other women.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3208/2422407266_544e667d28_o.gif" alt="reenactor" height="450" width="354" /><br />
In June 1938, Howard Jones Green, Nixonâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s sometime accomplice, was shipped from Chicago to view the murder scene at the Astoria.  He admitted to beating little Marguerite on the head (with his pistol butt, and not the brick) but denied partaking in the sexual assault, and admitted they grossed all of eight dollars from the venture.  He &#8216;fessed up to the March â€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />37 Zoe Damrell attack and for that was given five to life; what became of his Marguerite trial weâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />re not told.</p>
<p>On June 16, 1939, Robert Nixon went to the chair at the Cook County Jail.  Thus, he did not live to read 1940â€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s smash lit-hit <i>Native Son</i>, which explained that his predicament was destiny, a societal byproduct of racist racial conditioning.  So argued the lawyer for <i>Native Son</i>&#8216;s protagonist Bigger Thomas, accused of killing a white woman in Chicago, as penned by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Wright_(author)" title="Wrightian" target="_blank">Richard Wright</a>, who made great use of the sensationalistic Robert Nixon <a href="https://etext.virginia.edu/railton/enam312/rwhp.html" title="windypapers" target="_blank">newspaper reporting</a> at the time.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3225/2419663267_e4e7f681c2_o.gif" alt="demotime" align="right" height="300" width="165" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Less than a decade later, plans were underway to remove every trace of Bunker Hill&#8217;s 136 acres from existence.  After a four million dollar increase in annual taxes, and a grant from the federal Urban Renewal Program, oil tycoon William T. Sesnon Jr. finally began his twelve-year-in-the-making dream of wholesale land acquisition in October 1960.  Nine thousand persons were eventually displaced, and the first building to be demolished was the Astoriaâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s neighbor, the Hillcrest, in September 1961.  The Astoria went soon after.  The land sat barren for eighteen years until the federally subsidized, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Dworsky" title="dworky" target="_blank">Dworsky</a> modular prefab <a href="https://www.angelusplaza.org/RHFCMS/CommunityView.aspx?id=383" title="AP" target="_blank">Angelus Plaza</a> (designed with a 1200&#8242; People Mover) broke ground in 1979.</p>
