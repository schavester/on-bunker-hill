<p>The Hotel Trenton, seven stories of sober brick laced with fire escapes, its yawning central maw somewhere between a gate of hell and a jaunty fireman&#8217;s doorway, lurked low on Bunker Hill for many decades. There it is at 10 o&#8217;clock in the panorama. It was not a racy hotel, but it had its moments, and left an imprint on the fabric of its times.</p>
<p><img src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3018/2888657343_94f46e00ef_o.png"><br>
And speaking of imprints, it was July 1905 when a lady guest of the establishment marched into to the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> offices to report her dismay at having ruined her long white skirt, white stockings and slippers when she walked over the streetcar tracks at First and Broadway and picked up a liberal helping of petroleum, which the cars&#8217; operators had smeared on the rails to deafen the screech which otherwise came whenever a curve was taken. A snarky <i>Times</i> reporter noted that had the lady been as eager to lift her skirts when crossing the tracks as she was to show off the damage caused by the oil—&quot;and it&#8217;s higher up, too!&quot;—she would not be in such a predicament.</p>
<p><img src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3120/2889484804_7d17c1f50e_o.jpg"></p>
<p>In May 1906, town gossips received confirmation of a scandal, but too late to shun anyone involved. Some months earlier, Mrs. Genevieve Hughes arrived in Los Angeles from Denver and took rooms in the Trenton, where she was paid significant attention by fellow guest, Boston lawyer Charles W. Ward. Ward was briefly a Harvard man who took his degree from Columbia, a gymnast, a Knight Templar and a soldier, every inch the eligible young fellow&#8230; well, almost. Again and again he would ask that she marry him, and always she would demur—but not refuse his friendship. On February 28, Ward went into his room and shot himself in the head, and the whispers said it was out of thwarted love for Genevieve. The lady, however, had eyes for another, and quietly married A.G. Jones, also of Boston, departing for an Eastern honeymoon before news of the nuptials spread. And as for Ward, he was, it proved, a bounder, having left a wife and children awaiting the return of his health under the Californian sun. He lingered a few days after being shot, but died before his father could arrive by train.</p>
<p><img src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3108/2889484812_de0df72fd1.jpg"></p>
<p>In November 1907, Mexican Secret Service officer (and soon-to-be fink in the trial of revolutionary countrymen <a href="https://www.sandiegohistory.org/journal/99winter/magonista.htm" target="_blank">Magon</a>, Rivera and Villareal) Trinidad Vasquez left the safe harbor of the Trenton for a meal in a restaurant at Fifth and Olive. He had a ham and cheese sandwich and a cup of coffee, returned to the hotel and walked out again. In front of the Police Station, Vazquez was stricken with symptoms of poisoning and rushed to Receiving Hospital, where his stomach was pumped. Relieved, Vasquez testified that soon after eating he had felt a sense of suffocation, then felt as though his very heart would burst before blackness washed over him. He was soon released, doubtless with a greater respect for the fervor of the anarchist community of Los Angeles.</p>
<p>In early February 1909 it was revealed that the Trenton&#8217;s recently hired night clerk Harry Stevens was in fact Florin G. Lee, a Riverside lad who&#8217;d suffered a breakdown from overwork (dry goods clerking by day, electrical engineering study by night) or, some whispered, love unrequited, on December 30 and fled his home, shaking off all memory of his former life. When confronted by old friends, who said they knew him well, Stevens/ Lee expressed astonishment, and mused on his happier times in Iowa and Butte, Montana, and his New Years Day rail trip to Los Angeles over the Salt Lake Route. Conveyed to Riverside, he looked with bemusement upon his aged grandmother and treated the rest of the family with cordial unfamiliarity. He did not recognize the shop where he clerked for nine years, the books he had kept (quite well) or respond to the music which he formerly had loved. For two months, the stranger stayed on in Riverside as those who loved him tried to spark a memory of his past life. And then suddenly, on April 2, while in the dry goods store where he had long labored, Florin&#8217;s memory of his accounting work came flooding back. He raced to San Bernardino to share the happy, mathematical news with his father, and we hear no more about him.</p>
<p>On the evening of August 6, 1912, an &quot;elevator pilot&quot; was sent down to the basement to fetch some ice water. On the way up poked he his head out as the cage made its ascent. The ice water went everywhere, and so did the poor lad&#8217;s cranium. So complete was the destruction that there was initially some confusion when night clerk E.G. Merrifield came on the scene as to whether the dead man was Charles J. Oberman or his colleague, Earl Ansley. The victim was actually, it transpired, Earl McDonald, 18, from Riverside, who was moonlighting under the name Earl C. Ansley at the Trenton and working a day shift at the Hotel Victoria at Seventh at Hope. It was his first night on the job, and hotel manager R. Hughes was later charged for violating the state law requiring all elevator operators be properly licensed. </p>
<p>On February 3, 1913, S. W. Westmeyer, a successful mining man from Globe, Arizona, visited his wife at the Trenton and wrote her a check for $1025. From there, he went to the Hotel Redondo in Redondo Beach, where, the following evening, he shot himself in the head. Westmeyer left notes giving his personal effects to his wife and asking that his Lodge, Rescue No. 12 of the International Order of Odd Fellows in Globe be notified of his passing. </p>
<p>Later that month, the Trenton figured in the notorious jury tampering case of the great attorney Clarence Darrow, who rang up large charges at the hotel for select jurymen, far in excess of the $9 weekly rate that investigators were quoted—though it was the thirty dollars in ten cent cigars that got the jury&#8217;s goat.</p>
<p>In October 1915, resident Marie Kinney announced that she was moving her dressmaking parlor from the Fay Building at Third and Hill to the Trenton, and noted that help was wanted. A year later, she announced her winter reopening in suites 102-103-104, crowing &quot;choicest novelties in stock.&quot; Marie must have liked the place, for it was still her home on Valentine&#8217;s Day 1941, when, aged 80, she stepped in front of a Pacific Electric car on Huntington Drive near Poplar in El Sereno, and was killed instantly. Her rosary was said at Cunningham &amp; O&#8217;Conner at 1031 South Grand, requiem mass held at St. Vibiana&#8217;s and she was interred at Calvary.</p>
<p>In October 1917 the Los Angeles Division of the Collegiate Periodical League began a monthly drive to collect 5000 magazines, none older than ten days, for distribution among the servicemen at Camp Lewis. Among the district captains was Mrs. Alice M. Bryant of the Hotel Trenton. Your blogger will now attempt to staunch the drool inspired by the thought of what was gathered.</p>
<p>Late on December 2, 1930, the Trenton was among a trio of downtown hotels robbed by a pair of bandits in a taxicab. After they hit the Stillwell at 9th and Grand for $30 and a pair of guest handbags, unknowing driver George Kruger waited patiently outside the Trenton while night clerk A. E. Finnity and manager Herbert Perry were relieved of another $30. Finally the Victor Hotel at 616 South St. Paul was victim, and again yielded up a lucky thirty simolians. The thieves then paid their ferryman and slipped off into the night.</p>
<p>By 1933, we note that rooms were being let for a modest $3.50 a week. On June 8, 1936, Arnie J. Powers, 42, shot himself to death in his room, having failed to recover his health after coming out from Omaha.</p>
<p><img src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3095/2889484808_7d730923e2_o.jpg"><br>
On June 14, 1937 the Trenton hosted its most eloquent suicide, when retired schoolteacher Mrs. Ida Mae Mills, 70, gassed herself with a chloroform-soaked rag alongside an open copy of the book <i>The Right to Die.</i> Her note read, &quot;Remember this—Death should be a smooth finish, not a jagged interruption. There is nothing mysterious nor dramatic about this. Neither was it conceived in a moment of desperation. I think I am as sane as I ever was, but I have long been convinced of the wisdom of mercy killing. Why must I live on, tortured by constant pain, and facing total blindness? My abject apologies to the management for the trouble I am giving them, but I had to have some place to die, didn&#8217;t I? I could not vanish into the air.&quot;</p>
<p>She could not, but sometime in the early 1960s, it seems, the Trenton Hotel did just that. We can only assume the CRA had a little something to do with that.</p>

<p>For nearly seventy years the Richelieu Hotel resided next door to the better known Melrose. The pair of Queen Anne Victorian buildings were two of the most stunning structures on the Hill, but the Richelieu always stood in the shadow of its counterpart. The Melrose once played host to President McKinley, was memorialized by artists like Leo Politi, and was covered by local press when the wrecking crews came. The Richelieu on the other hand, was far less celebrated but no less important, making its small mark on the history of a neighborhood that no longer exists.</p>

<p>The Richelieu Hotel was built by Richard E. Larkin and his wife Helen, and opened around 1891. Apparently the hotel was not particularly plush, for when the Larkins sold it to a Chicago business man a mere two years after it was built, the Times reported that “the purchaser will spend considerable money giving the house a thorough overhauling, and will run it as a first class hotel.”&#157; The overhaul was successful, and the Richelieu played host to society gatherings, and many local families and single residents would call the hotel home. Â </p>

<p>
For the most part, the Richelieu maintained a relatively tranquil existence, with a bit of color thrown in here and there. In March of 1901, a bold burglar successfully struck Bunker Hill five times in one night, including the room J.F. Currier was occupying at the Richelieu. The cagey criminal was an expert lock picker who entered Currier&#8217;s room and made off with $150 in cash and a gold pocket watch without disturbing the resident&#8217;s slumber. The hotel was the victim of another burglary in 1904 when thieves entered the room of Mr. &amp; Mrs. Bob Northam. The culprits were lucky that the Northams were out. The couple had been robbed a few months earlier and the Mrs had responded by lodging a bullet in the fleeing burglar. Of the more recent crime, Mrs. Northam expressed regrets that she was not around to take a shot at the thieves.</p>

<p>
In May of 1949, the Times reported that a pair of detectives were investigating a narcotics lead at the Richelieu, when Ricardo Rameriez walked in on the pair. He attempted to quickly walk out, but was nabbed by the detectives who found $800 worth of heroin on him. One of the detectives spotted Rameriez&#8217;s wife waiting in a car down the street and asked her if she wanted to join her husband in jail. “Might as well,”&#157; she said and off she went. The next day, the detectives found the couple&#8217;s $36,000 smack stash at a hotel on Figueroa.</p>

No Bunker Hill boarding house history would be complete without at least one suicide. The Richelieu&#8217;s came in 1933 when Sylvia Norris, a 55 year old trained nurse, strangled herself in her room with a hose. According to her husband who found her, Mrs. Norris was despondent over ill health.</p>

<p></p>
<p>One of the Richelieu&#8217;s more interesting residents was Walter Hallowell, who resided at the hotel for at least ten years. In the 1930s, Hallowell was president of the Bunker Hill Non Partisan Voter&#8217;s League and held meetings in his room. By the 1940s, he had established his Richelieu residence as headquarters for the California Shut-In Stamp Club. The club sought donations in order to provide the state&#8217;s some 60,000 shut-ins with stamp collections.Â  Hallowell and the club also offered correspondence courses in short hand, as well as a complete booklet on a variety of ways to play solitaire. Hallowell hoped that the club&#8217;s efforts would “bring some pleasure to a shut-in.”&#157;</p>

<p>
Unlike many of the Victorian structures on Bunker Hill which quickly fell into disrepair, the Richelieu was always well taken care of. In 1939, when the WPA performed a household census of the area, the Richelieu and its thirty-nine units were listed as in “good condition.”&#157; The hotel suffered a fire in 1954, but the damage appears to have been minimal.</p>

<p>In May of 1956, the Times reported that the interior of the Richelieu was being redecorated and modernized and “perhaps, once again will be a proud residence.”&#157; When the Times extensively covered the demolition of the Melrose a year later, the Richelieu was already gone.</p>

<p>The next time you take in a show at the Ahmanson Theater or the Mark Taper Forum, take a minute and think about the St Angelo Hotel. For 70 years the impressive Victorian structure dominated the corner of Grand and Temple where the Music Center now stands. From stately hotel to slum boarding house, the St Angelo represented Bunker Hill in all its glory and decline.</p>
<div style="text-align: center">
<img src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3273/2585744865_34d4897a32.jpg?v=0" alt="St Angelo in its glory days" width="400">
</div>
<p>
The St. Angelo Hotel was built in 1887 by a Mrs. A.M. Smith who hoped to cash in on the big SoCal land boom of the 1880s, which brought countless migrants to the area. Like many structures built on the Hill during this period, the St Angelo was an elaborate Victorian building that the Los Angeles Times described as having “balconies with ornate woodwork and varicolored small squares of glass are in the upper parts of the windows.”&#157; As for the interior, the St. Angelo had “winding stairways which with other woodwork are of redwood”&#157; with “wide landings that are parlors on each floor.”&#157;  </p>
<div style="text-align: center">
<img src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3002/2586580762_ffff3be005.jpg?v=0" alt="St Angelo " width="300">
</div>
<p></p>
<p>Unfortunately, Mrs. Smith&#8217;s timing was a bit off. When the St. Angelo opened, the booming 80s were winding down and the hotel did not fare as well as planned. In August 1889, the hotel was shut down by the sheriff due to an attachment on the property, but was able to reopen three months later. Mrs. Smith held onto the hotel for twelve years, waiting for prosperous times to return, but ultimately had to give up the property.</p>
<div style="text-align: center">
<img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3098/2585744977_b7c0cfff83.jpg?v=0" height="87" width="413">
</div>
<p>Prosperity did come to the St Angelo in the early years of the 20th Century and the hotel hosted many parties, weddings and conferences. Guests were frequently mentioned in the society pages. While the patrons of  the St. Angelo may have been of a more refined type, the same could not always be said of its employees. For example, there was no love lost between Mr. Cole, the hotel cook, and Mr. Brown another hotel employee, who were known to frequently spar. One day in March of 1902, all hell broke lose and Brown and Cole chased each other around the kitchen throwing, “catsup bottles, dining-room chairs, and other utensils that came handy.”&#157; The authorities were summoned and Brown was fined $5. </p>
<p>In 1904, Mrs. A.M. Smith came back in the picture when she realized that she legally still retained, as the L.A. Times reported, a strip of land “seven and one half feet, extending from Grand avenue to Bunker Hill avenue and passing directly under the St. Angelo.”&#157; The property owners demanded that she hand over the deed to this strip of land, but Mrs. Smith held out for the cash settlement. She finally made a profit on the St. Angelo.</p>

</div>
<p>No boarding house on Bunker Hill would be complete without a bit of death and mayhem. In 1906, Charles Malan, a Frenchman suffering from consumption and depleted funds, did himself in by sealing off all the doors and cracks of his room and turning on the gas. Then there is the sad story of Frederick Merrill, an 87 year old inventor and resident who slipped on a banana peel on Main Street and died from his injuries a couple of weeks later. Finally, in 1943 a fight broke out in the hotel&#8217;s lobby and Mrs. Mae Perry, the hotel manager, broke up the scuffle&#8230;with a gun. Rubio Ernesto, 17 and not a hotel guest was killed in the incident. </p>

</div>
<p>
By 1939, when a WPA census was conducted, the St. Angelo and its 57 units were in need of “major repairs.”&#157; As the Los Angeles Times noted, “it is an old wooden pile now proudly in decline, a genteel old building still snobbish among the smaller structures around it which were built not much later.”&#157; Despite the hotel&#8217;s shabby condition, it stood proudly on the Hill until the board of health ordered it vacated in 1956. All traces of the once grand hotel were soon erased and replaced by the Music Center which was dedicated in 1964. </p>

The Astoria contains over 125 guest rooms, beautifully furnished.  Many are en suite, with parlor, bedroom and bath, dining-room and kitchen.  A number of single rooms are also provided, both with and without private bath.  Among the attractive features of the Astoria is the beautiful view of the city to be obtained from practically every room of the building.  A spacious office and lobby, a dainty ladies’ reception-room, and a dancing hall are some the features which have been provided by E. W. Smith, the owner of the building.  These are handsomely decorated and furnished, and will undoubtedly serve to make the Astoria popular.  </i>

<p>—December 17, 1905</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before Bunker Hill hit its cinematic skids, t’was the place of purloinery more aligned with the tony climes of Monte Carlo than El Monte:  cat-burgling jewel thieves were at <img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3076/2420296782_74d6ffbdaf_o.gif" alt="purloinery" align="left" height="173" width="284">work!  In October of 1911, Astoria resident Mrs. W. F. Sapp returned to her room one afternoon to find…nothing amiss.  But her mother, Mrs. W. W. Loomis, of the adjoining apartment, called attention to having heard her daughter next door at her writing desk while said daughter was supposed to be absent.  They opened the locked writing desk…to behold…<i>gasp</i>!  The chatelaine bag, lockets and bracelets and the like were gone, as was the ancestral family tin box (found later in the lavatory, a can opener found on the fifth floor above) once filled with gold watches, fobs, and diamond-set pieces, now scattered to the underworld of crooked, loupe-wearing bangle merchants.</p>
<p>But not all crimes at the Astoria were so <i>quaint</i>.<br>
<img loading="lazy" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2062/2418256946_b9545ff293_o.gif" alt="astoria50s" height="390" width="550"><br>
Edna A. Worden lived in the Astoria.  Forty-eight, New Hampshirite, kept to herself mostly, known around the place as a woman of culture and refinement.   Kept the bookshelves of her one-bedroom in the Astoria lined with Shakespeare, Milton, Dante, Dickens, Byron, Poe, the Greek philosophers, and many a Bible.  She made a meager wage as a WPA worker, and with the monthly $30 sent to her by her ex-husband back east, made a good life for her and her twelve year-old daughter Marguerite.</p>
<p>Marguerite, a student at Belmont Junior High School who, had she made it to Monday, was to have entered a Beverly Hills school for girls.  </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2115/2419482523_d626744857_o.gif" alt="MargueriteW" align="right" height="500" width="259">Sunday, April 4, 1937.  Little Marguerite made a habit of always coming down to the desk to borrow the Sunday paper.  This morning she did not.  A concerned John Riley, the elevator operator, put an ear to the Wordens’ door and ascertained a low moan; he summoned Astoria manager J. E. Harrigan, who, with his trusty stepladder, peered through the transom.  After what he saw police arrived in short order and even hardened Detective Lieutenants Ledbetter, Bryan and Lopez, after kicking in the door, had to halt in their tracks at the horror that lay in wait.  </p>
<p>Edna lay sprawled over a cot in an array of splatter, her head against the floor.  Marguerite was on the bed, her head covered with a pillow, topped with a discarded brickbat, mortar glued to its sides, sticky with blood and gore. The room was cluttered, revealing a desperate struggle during their sexual assaults and skull shatterings.  Edna’s purse was turned inside-out, otherwise, the room was unrifled—Marguerite’s mute witness rag doll, her ivory-bound prayer book with a shiny dime atop, her freshly washed and ironed blue gingham dress on a nail above the bed.  The fates conspired to aid their attacker; on one side of the apartment was a storeroom, on the other, the apartment of old Harry Tutin, partially deaf.</p>

Bunker Hill was blanketed by the entire homicide squad assigned to all-night duty, with four squads of regular detectives and fifty men from Metro combing the City for suspicious Black Men—not exactly racial profiling, since it was a black man who ran from the scene of the attempted January 25 brick-attack on Mrs. H. W. Koll in <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=2830+Glendale+Blvd,+90039&amp;jsv=107&amp;sll=34.109868,-118.26381&amp;sspn=0.008546,0.01457&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=34.109868,-118.26381&amp;spn=0.008546,0.01457&amp;t=h&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr" title="2830" target="_blank">Monte Sano</a> <a href="https://silverlake.tribe.net/photos/c686a18c-c1aa-4d27-b9bb-d18eb879ea50" title="montedeatho" target="_blank">hospital</a>; the February 3 <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/californiapete/244927668/sizes/l/" title="barclay" target="_blank">Barclay</a> hotel room skull fracturing of Elizabeth Reis (again, leaving his brick behind); and the March 28 Zoe Damrell attack in her home at <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=1026+Ingraham+St,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90017&amp;jsv=107&amp;sll=34.055166,-118.26175&amp;sspn=0.008551,0.01457&amp;layer=c&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=34.05129,-118.262522&amp;spn=0.008551,0.01457&amp;t=h&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr&amp;cbll=34.051949,-118.262424" title="damrellattack" target="_blank">1026 Ingraham</a>, she left barely alive by a brick-bearing assailant who bore remarkable resemblance to the large black gentleman seen lurking by the Valdez house immediately before her murder.</p>
<p>Assorted Los Angeles sickos—<i>alleged</i>—were brought in for questioning, their faces and addresses plastered throughout the papers (doubtlessly tarnishing their lives forevermore) but all were cleared, not only through their alibis, but because the Worden killer had the bad fortune of leaving something else behind besides his brickbat:  before putting on his gloves, he moved a milk bottle.  Fingerprint central.  </p>
<p>So if the killer skipped town, there’s a good chance he could have, would have never been caught.  But a certain Robert Nixon just had to kill women.  With bricks.  This time in Chicago, on May 28, 1938, the nineteen year-old Nixon brick’d Mrs. Florence Johnson, wife of a Chicago city fireman, and gets popped for it, and confesses.  A little digging revealed that during the time of the Worden and Valdez killings, he lived at <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=803+S+Central+Ave,+90021&amp;jsv=107&amp;sll=34.033528,-118.243339&amp;sspn=0.008553,0.01457&amp;layer=c&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=34.034951,-118.243339&amp;spn=0.008553,0.01457&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr&amp;cbll=34.033518,-118.243315" title="nixonsplace" target="_blank">803 South Central Avenue</a>.  </p>
<p>Nixon initially denied involvement with the crimes, but after LA Police Chief Davis announced that comparison of fingerprints made positive identification of Nixon, Nixon admitted to the whole brick-laden shebang—the Wordens and Valdez, plus the Chicago murders of Mrs. Florence Thompson Castle in her hotel room in 1936, and the rape/murder of student nurse Anna Kuchta in August 1937, and assaults on at least seventeen other women.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3208/2422407266_544e667d28_o.gif" alt="reenactor" height="450" width="354"><br>
In June 1938, Howard Jones Green, Nixon’s sometime accomplice, was shipped from Chicago to view the murder scene at the Astoria.  He admitted to beating little Marguerite on the head (with his pistol butt, and not the brick) but denied partaking in the sexual assault, and admitted they grossed all of eight dollars from the venture.  He &#8216;fessed up to the March ’37 Zoe Damrell attack and for that was given five to life; what became of his Marguerite trial we’re not told.</p>
<p>On June 16, 1939, Robert Nixon went to the chair at the Cook County Jail.  Thus, he did not live to read 1940’s smash lit-hit <i>Native Son</i>, which explained that his predicament was destiny, a societal byproduct of racist racial conditioning.  So argued the lawyer for <i>Native Son</i>&#8216;s protagonist Bigger Thomas, accused of killing a white woman in Chicago, as penned by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Wright_(author)" title="Wrightian" target="_blank">Richard Wright</a>, who made great use of the sensationalistic Robert Nixon <a href="https://etext.virginia.edu/railton/enam312/rwhp.html" title="windypapers" target="_blank">newspaper reporting</a> at the time.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3225/2419663267_e4e7f681c2_o.gif" alt="demotime" align="right" height="300" width="165"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Less than a decade later, plans were underway to remove every trace of Bunker Hill&#8217;s 136 acres from existence.  After a four million dollar increase in annual taxes, and a grant from the federal Urban Renewal Program, oil tycoon William T. Sesnon Jr. finally began his twelve-year-in-the-making dream of wholesale land acquisition in October 1960.  Nine thousand persons were eventually displaced, and the first building to be demolished was the Astoria’s neighbor, the Hillcrest, in September 1961.  The Astoria went soon after.  The land sat barren for eighteen years until the federally subsidized, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Dworsky" title="dworky" target="_blank">Dworsky</a> modular prefab <a href="https://www.angelusplaza.org/RHFCMS/CommunityView.aspx?id=383" title="AP" target="_blank">Angelus Plaza</a> (designed with a 1200&#8242; People Mover) broke ground in 1979.</p>

		<p>The Minnewaska, aka The Dome, played host to no small quantity of characters over the course of her life.  Over the course of this blog you’ll be introduced to your fair share of them.  Here then is a brief introduction to this, their home.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2383/2363258642_cce2deb895_o.gif" alt="minnie1903" height="488" width="550"></p>
<p>Our first mention of the Minnewaska comes in the form of this notice regarding building permits, January 11, 1903:<br>
<img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3077/2363363716_11d9d7833d_o.jpg" alt="minniebldngpermit" align="middle" height="122" width="261"><br>
She is completed within the year and on December 20 described in the <i>Times</i> thusly:</p>
<div align="justify">
…recently completed by J M Shield on the southwest corner of Grand avenue and Second street…the location, only three blocks from Broadway and Second street, and near the highest point of Olive Heights, is one which is both desirable and commanding.<br>
The house is a four-story combination frame and cement structure with tower.<br>
Its foundation is a heavy brick wall imbedded in solid red gravel.  Very heavy dimension timbers were used as the owner contemplated adding two or more stories to the building at some time in the future.  The outer walls are covered with heavy diagonals and on this surface is placed steel lath and two coats of cement plaster.  The latter is tinted a delicate cream color, which gives the building a very pleasing exterior.
</div>
<div align="justify">
The interior is arranged in flats of two and four rooms each, which are supplied with private baths, marble-topped wash stands, electric bells, steam heat, and such other modern conveniences as are usually found in the best apartment hotels.<br>
The house contains 122 guests’ rooms and thirty-seven bathrooms, besides dining-room, kitchen, storeroom, cold-storage and furnace rooms, office and reception-room.  The latter are finished in paneled oak and have decorated ceilings.<br>
The apartments are finished in white cedar, and are so arranged that each room can be entered from a hall.  The building could therefore be easily converted into a regular commercial hotel.<br>
Its main hall is arranged as an open court, and its roof garden affords a view of the surrounding country that extends from the mountains to the sea.<br>
The building cost about $65,000.  The lot on which it stands extends westward to Bunker Hill avenue and affords space for an extension to the present building that would give it a frontage of about 400 feet on the three streets and a total of 200 guests’ rooms.
</div>
<p>Sold in 1905, the Minnewaska remains so named in the city directories until 1907, when she becomes, simply and more descriptively, the Dome.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2291/2364173105_d5591a86e5_o.gif" alt="domebigpic" height="551" width="400"></p>
<p>And sure, you&#8217;re to read here about all manner of shady and shifty character who occupied 201 South Grand during the Dome’s heyday, but I’ll delight most in telling you of Frank Babcock, one of the Dome’s owners, the man who through the late 1950s took on the Community Redevelopment Agency in lawsuit after lawsuit pointing out, and correctly, that the CRA had no right to condemn the Hill&#8217;s habitable property and certainly not to use public money to do so (Babcock’s theory that oil bigwig/CRA chairman William T. Sesnon Jr. was after Bunker Hill for its oil reserves is a bit fanciful, but is, in fact, backed up by the area’s hydrocarbon geology—but all things in due time).</p>
<p>On the morning  of July 25, 1964, the Dome burst into flame, and as mentioned by Richard <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/Minnewaska" title="minnieburns" target="_blank">here</a>, there’s been some question as to just how and why the Dome, most prominent and distantly visible of the Bunker Hill structures, burned.  While there had been some land purchases and building demolitions, despite the CRA’s inception in 1948, they had by 1964 accomplished very little.  Was the burning of the Dome a &quot;push&quot; in the &quot;right direction&quot;?  (After Mayor Yorty called for an audit of the agency’s redevelopment techniques, it was determined in 1966 that the CRA used shoddy business practices to achieve limited progress, despite simple goals that, according to a report four months in the making, myopically favored bulldozers over rehabilitation and conservation.)<br>

Conspiracies aside, she burns, her cremains removed and scattered to the four winds:<br>
<img loading="lazy" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2291/2370422928_a7bf8ec3a1_o.gif" alt="beingrazed" height="400" width="178"><br>
“&#8230;will give way to a parking lot until the renewal project gets under way.”&#157;  She’s been a parking lot since October 1964:<br>
<img loading="lazy" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2196/2363244068_05e3cde2be_o.gif" alt="domeflyover" height="254" width="550"><br>
The Disney Hall and Colburn School (right and bottom) are new additions; on the left is the 1989 Grand Promenade Apartments, which, judging by the <a href="https://www.apartmentratings.com/rate/CA-Los-Angeles-Grand-Promenade-Tower.html" title="lessthangrand" target="_blank">reviews</a>, certainly indicates the CRA did a great job.</p>
<p>Forty-four years as a parking lot but not, perhaps, forever, given this hint from the planning department regarding the tract: <br>

&#8230;and so on.</p>
