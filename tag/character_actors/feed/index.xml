										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>February 14, 1924</p>
<p>62-year-old John Byrne, a character actor who typically played the role of the grizzled old sourdough in films, was found dead in his room at 509 Temple Street, a boarding house.  Police investigating the room found that a tube that connected the gas to a small heater had been pulled, or accidentally kicked, loose.</p>
<p>It was unclear whether Byrne, whose real name was John McGuire, had intended to die.</p>
<p>There was no suicide note, and it appeared that at his time of death, Byrne had been reading a western story in a popular magazine.  The magazine was opened to page 41, the last page of the story, and the last line read, &quot;And so, with the same old cheery smile on his sun-cracked lips, Sagebrush Jim came to the end of the trail.&quot;</p>
