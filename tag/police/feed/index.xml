										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After the DWP and Dorothy Chandler went up, postcard photographers said <i>whoopee! something to shoot besides City Hall and the Chinese</i>.  So they cruised up to the bluff on <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=Huntley+Dr,+Los+Angeles,+Los+Angeles,+California+90026&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=35.684144,56.601563&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;cd=2&amp;geocode=FQCvBwIdbIrz-A&amp;split=0&amp;ll=34.058686,-118.257115&amp;spn=0.00912,0.013819&amp;t=h&amp;z=16" title="grassytrolls" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Huntley</a>, trained their lenses across Second and Beaudry toward First and Flower and fired away.  The day view is a Plastichrome by Colourpicture, the night view by Western Publishing &amp; Novelty, both circa 1965.</p>

<p>Dig the Union station in all its <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG9Ypr-jM0" title="76day" target="_blank" rel="noopener">76</a> ball <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSkUFY-6weM&amp;feature=related" title="76nite" target="_blank" rel="noopener">glory</a> (the SoCal station with its backlit chevron seems to be of an earlier vintage; they‘re both gone now).  Printers shops and giant spools line Beaudry.  Were it not for the necessity of capturing Becket and Martin‘s latest accomplishments, would we have any record of these?  Not likely.</p>
<p>Across the Pasadena Freeway, on Bunker Hill proper, on the west side of Figueroa between First and Second, that big white structure?  That‘s 123 South Figueroa, built in 1925.  Whatever the most photographed buildings on Bunker Hill were–the Castle, the Brousseau, the Dome?–if there‘s another image of <i>this</i> structure, I‘d love to see it.<br />
<img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3643/3332333090_9ae47f3779_o.gif" alt="Sanborn1955" height="376" width="575" /></p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3605/3334045309_1ef1db532c_o.gif" alt="theycallmethewanderer" align="right" height="185" width="250" /><br />
123 was erected as an office building, but in 1934 is turned into “one of the largest and most modern” government relief centers in the West.  The Federal Transient Service converted the building into its Southern California headquarters, i.e., a shelter for non-resident jobless men, outfitting it with an enormous cafeteria and dormitories that slept 500.  It became a veritable city in itself:  showers, lockers, hospital, educational and recreational facilities were installed, as were a laundry, shoe repair and tailor shop.  It was also a warehouse for materials and supplies used in the camps.  Yes, the camps.  Itinerant men had forty-eight hours to stay at Figueroa, max, before being assigned out of the city to transient work camps in forest and mountain areas.</p>
<p>Families, bands of “wild boys,” vagabonds on freight cars”¦in 1935 32,000 new transients came to California each month, 12,000 of those to Los Angeles.  July of 1935 alone saw a load of 20,000  paupers arrive in LA seeking State and Federal aid.  (And, one supposes, oranges that grew on palm trees.)  1,200 boys were sent to forestry camps, 4,000 men to the Federal aid camp near San Diego, but many of LA‘s transients–12% of the national and 60% of the State‘s burden–after being processed here at 123 South Fig, ended up in squatter‘s villages and squalid encampments.  Many went to homes and camps, were absorbed to into County Welfare healthily, found employ in the works relief programs or went back from whence they came, but either way, it does show and say something about the class shift of the Hill that such a major locus of poverty and despair should be located within its confines.</p>
<p>123 is converted to the police department‘s traffic division headquarters building in 1942.  The City Council gave the Police Commission $78,000 for the building and another $47,000 for the alterations.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3406/3334898604_3eea6796e7_o.gif" alt="deadication" height="158" width="400" />At the dedication, during a luncheon given on the third floor, attended by Mayor Bowron, Chief of Police Horral, and numerous high ranking police officers, Deputy Police Chief Caldwell announced that Los Angeles led the nation in the decrease in auto fatalities–which occurred through “strict, scientific enforcement of driving regulations.”  (Reports from 123 show that pedestrian fatalities in the first half of the 40s skyrocketed–dimouts for the war effort, don‘t ya know.)</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3360/3334879384_d7d19b0991_o.gif" alt="motorbike50" height="93" width="223" /><br />
The biggest piece of drama attached to the building came when in 1950 Parry Cottam, 27, a maintenance man at the police garage in the building, was moving a police motorcycle and it went out of control.  It plunged him through a large plate-glass window on the building‘s street level, and he was found unconscious on the sidewalk.  </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3632/3334045373_a4d118e4ba_o.gif" alt="theSale" align="right" height="123" width="242" /><br />
In March of 1964, the Board of Supervisors authorized sale of the county building to the CRA.  The CRA said they intended to develop the site into a motel.  The garage equipment goes up for auction in April 1971 and the 123 is presumably demolished failry soon thereafterward.  While the CRA didn‘t build a motel after clearing the site, the <a href="http://www.you-are-here.com/los_angeles/promenade.html" title="PTs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Promenade Towers</a>  have at least been described as a “<a href="http://www.apartmentratings.com/rate/CA-Los-Angeles-Promenade-Towers.html" title="thirtyonepercent" target="_blank" rel="noopener">roach motel</a>.”</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3359/3332332962_abe7c085c7_o.gif" alt="garagey" height="295" width="340" /></p>

<p>It‘s a $60million dollar complex, the first mixed-use apartment complex in downtown Los Angeles and the area‘s first privately owned residential rental complex.  It has its formal opening June 16, 1986, the name <i>Promenade</i> intending to connote the era of pedestrian-oriented urbanism this project will usher in.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3540/3334045411_f2a1655c07_o.gif" alt="promPool" height="303" width="200" /></p>
<p>The Promenade becomes a favorite of Union Bank; they keep sixteen apartments there for visiting businessmen.  Tommy Lasorda himself keeps a pad in the Prom.  They‘re all drawn by the health club and gymnasium, market, pharmacy, dentist, cafÃ©/restaurant, the 24-hour reception and valet and garage attendants and so forth.  </p>

It remains to be seen whether the 123 regains its Reagan-era splendor, or if its residents, with their dry cleaner and little shop of sundries, doesn‘t harken back to its forgotten days as a haven for homeless men and law enforcement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Location: 350 Clay Street<br />
Date: June 3, 1946</p>
<p>In the not-quite-twelve hours since John M. Kelly was discharged from the Marine Corps, he somehow took up with Henry Ehlert, 44, and Dwight C. Lester, 23, of this address and John Graham, 43, a Naval chief petty officer stationed in San Diego.</p>
<p>Kelly&#8217;s first night as a civilian was a notable one: he and his pals drew the attention of Traffic Officer F.J. Rees, investigating reports of a holdup in an alley between Main and Spring, and when Kelly made a funny move when ordered to put &#8217;em up, Rees shot half his face off.</p>
<p>Kelly survived long enough to be booked on robbery charges in the prison ward of General Hospital, while his pals cooled their heels in County Jail. But the lack of any follow up to this story makes one wonder if Rees had an itchy finger, and the arrests were meant to cover up an accidental shooting of an innocent man. </p>
<p>The previous November 10, hapless Dwight C. Lester, then residing at 300 S. Olive Street, somehow lost his footing, fell under the up-bound Angels Flight car and was dragged about 60 feet before engineer Elmer Miller heard him hollering and braked. He escaped with friction burns and lacerations. Below, a photograph of his rescue.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>May 22, 1919<br />317 S. Flower Street, Saratoga Hotel<br /><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3285/2451419572_874aba1a1a_o.jpg" alt="saratogahotel" align="left" height="65" width="268" />A building permit for a 3-story brick lodging house that would become the Saratoga Hotel was issued to W.W. Paden and Louis Nordlinger in the summer of 1914.  A year later, the hotel was offered for sale, exchange, or lease, offering &quot;long lease, good furniture, and cheap rent.&quot;</p>
<p>By 1919, the hotel had already acquired something of a reputation, and was home to many show business types.  On May 22, A.W. Gifford, head of the City&#8217;s Purity Squad led a raid on the hotel and arrested 32 people on charges of living in a house of prostitution.  Members of the Purity Squad had taken rooms at the Saratoga during the week prior to the raid, and gathered evidence during that time.</p>
<p>Police tore apart the Saratoga&#8217;s 200 rooms, confiscated hundreds of bottles of liquor and beer, and questioned all occupants.  Anyone who could not prove steady employment, and any man and woman found together in the same room without a marriage license were taken to City Jail.</p>
<p>Many of those arrested said they worked in the movies as extras, but police determined that &quot;extra work is not considered real work.&quot;</p>
<p>The next day, however, 22 of those arrested were released without charges.  The owner of the hotel, Charles H. Price of Monrovia, assumed responsibility, and promised to install a new building manager in an agreement forged with City Prosecutor Widney.  Widney explained away the releases, claiming that the raids were staged merely &quot;to break up certain conditions believed to exist.&quot;</p>
<p>So, it wasn&#8217;t a whorehouse&#8230; but it might have turned into one if left unchecked.  Thanks Purity Squad!</p>
<p>An angry letter to the editor followed on the heels of the raid, signed only &quot;Justice.&quot;  It read:</p>
<p><i>&quot;How is a stranger, a girl alone in a strange city, for instance, to know positively that she is in a respectable neighborhood or house?  She may have places recommended by the YMCA, the YWCA, the Bible Institute, and yet find herself in an undesirable location.  Nobody can be certain.</i></p>
<p><i>What do you think of five men in civilian clothes with no badges or authority &#8212; or, at least none visible &#8212; bursting into the room of a girl at an unseemly hour, insulting her, accusing her of crime, when she knows absolutely nothing of the reason for such an assault&#8230; Do you think five ruffians like that, cowards, would do so if a man were in the room with a gun?  Hardly.&quot; </i></p>

<p>Six weeks ago, he and his mother moved to 111 S. Figueroa, right next door to the local traffic division, and Ronnie was overjoyed.  He started hanging around the station, and got to know the officers, who adopted him as a mascot of sorts.  He also followed them out on the streets, mimicking their lingo and actions.  Rather than being annoyed, the officers were so impressed with little Ronnie that they gave him a hat and a whistle, and put him to work.  Today, Ronnie directed traffic at 2nd and Figueroa, and Sgt. C.W. Nanney declared that his performance would be a credit to any veteran traffic cop.</p>
<p>However, Ronnie proved surprisingly easy to lure from his post.  When his mother appeared at the corner with an ice cream bar for her son, the hard-working lad went AWOL.</p>
