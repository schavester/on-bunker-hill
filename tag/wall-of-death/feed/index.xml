										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>*[Update to this post: after reviewing other newly digitzed footage shot on the same day as the Wall of Death discussed below, George Mann&#8217;s son Brad Smith now believes that this footage was actually shot at the <i>Oakland</i> Orpheum Theatre, sometime between March 31-April 6, 1928. The act and the players were identical to what was seen in March 1928 in Los Angeles.]</b></p>
<p>Today On Bunker Hill is proud to present another little something special from the archives of George Mann, an artifact that predates his astonishing <a href="/georgemannshop" target="_blank">color photographs</a> of Bunker Hill by about thirty years.</p>
<p>In March 1928, the comedic dance team of Barto &amp; Mann were billed on the vaudeville stage of Los Angeles&#8217; Orpheum Theatre with a slew of acts who are today mostly forgotten, but who had reached the top of a very competitive entertainment industry. It was during this run that the very-small-and-awful-tall Barto &amp; Mann were praised by the <i>L.A. Times</i> as &#8220;a knockout team.&#8221;</p>
<p><img src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4053/4653170710_c9ba1e7084.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>A not-yet-39 Jack Benny was on the bill, as was the magician <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVe7chIgn0w" target="_blank">Cardini</a> (still billed as &#8220;The Gay Deceiver;&#8221; later on, he became &#8220;Suave&#8221;). <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQvZUltlRRw&amp;feature=related" target="_blank">Charlotte Greenwood</a> appeared &#8220;in her morning bath&#8221; &#8212; a bit in which the dancer-comedienne was forever stopped from disrobing by the inopportune arrival of a range of visitors. Also appearing were the pratfalling comic <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPkJag707o&amp;feature=relmfu" target="_blank">Lupino Lane</a> (Ida&#8217;s uncle), <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0875877/" target="_blank">Harland Tucker</a> and <a href="https://content.lib.washington.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/sayrepublic&amp;CISOPTR=2974&amp;CISOBOX=1&amp;REC=8" target="_blank">Carl McCullough</a> singing &#8220;When I Was a Dandy and You Were a Belle.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then there was the <a href="https://www.thewallofdeath.co.uk/early44.htm" target="_blank">Tom Davies Trio</a>&#8211;up at the top of the bill, but something of a mystery until the film snippet below was digitized by George Mann&#8217;s son Brad Smith, some 84 years after his father captured this astonishing scene.</p>
<p>Friends, we bring you the celebrated and terrifying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_of_death_(carnival_sideshow)" target="_blank">Wall of Death</a>, live on the Orpheum stage! And in July 2012, you can see the first <a href="https://lavatransforms.org/mann7122012" target="_blank">exhibition</a> anywhere of George Mann&#8217;s Bunker Hill photographs, just steps away from the Orpheum at the Take My Picture gallery.</p>
