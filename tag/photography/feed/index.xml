										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>Hillzapoppin</i>&#8216; in the OBH!  A couple swanky new color images emerged from the greater Mann grotto and the good people at the archives wanted to share them with <i>you</i>.  Ain&#8217;t they the best?</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4143/4751217862_a268081233_b.jpg" alt="AF1" height="502" width="468" /></p>
<p>This image is later than the other Manns (Menn?) we&#8217;ve seen.  (Given the specific progress made on the Union Bank tower, I&#8217;d peg this photo at September 1966).  By comparison, here&#8217;s one of late-50s vintage you&#8217;ve seen before:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4078/4750573645_0aaae6c9ca_o.jpg" alt="AF2" height="500" width="468" /></p>
<p>The Community Redevelopment Agency got their wreckers and worked from top to bottom; started with the Elks in the autum of 1962, then hit the Hulburt (middle) and finished the Ferguson on Hill in &#8217;63.</p>
<p>With Angels Flight&#8217;s Western Wall removed, you then see <a href="/theEms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">these</a> <a href="/KelloggPalaceCasaAlta" title="CasAl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two</a> characters in images of the Flight, but they were chewed up pretty quickly.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4081/4750574321_804ff30489_o.jpg" alt="theseguys" height="403" width="468" /></p>
<p>But back to our original Mann photo up top.  To the east of the flight on the other side of the tunnel, the Royal Liquor&#8217;s still there, and so&#8217;s the McCoy house above.  </p>
<p>Royal Liquor&#8211;AKA St. Helena Sanitarium&#8211;always amuses because before Los Angeles became last refuge for the hunted and the tortured, it was just a sunny place to go for salubrious living:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4115/4750574373_f97157fe06_b.jpg" alt="weggie" height="538" width="300" /></p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s cross the intersection, down Hill a bit&#8230;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4099/4751218214_5b084b1b7b_b.jpg" alt="afotherside" height="501" width="468" /></p>
<p>&#8230;turn to see that Olivet and Sinai have passed each other.  The Hill Crest and the Sunshine, of whom we&#8217;ve spoken quite a bit recently, gone, again, the CRA working down from Olive to Clay, the HillCrest lost in the autumn of 1961 and the Sunshine goes ca. 1965.  There&#8217;s the McCoy House and St. Helena, although now the latter, known as My Hotel for some time, became the Vista Hotel between 1942 and &#8217;47 (and the actual full name of its corner booze boutique, despite what the neon read, was Royal Gold Liquors).  Vaguely visible looming behind in the mist, the <a href="/HotelBelmont" title="belmont" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Belmont</a>.</p>
<p>The former front door of the Ferguson CafÃ© apparently a swell place to park your faded yellow jalopy.  In September of 1966.  Now, not so much.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4139/4751453054_d4cc73fc19_o.jpg" alt="nowwee" height="324" width="468" /></p>
<p>Hey, at least the light pole and fireplug are still there. </p>

<!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--><!--[endif]-->I begin my post as did Kim not with shots of Bunker Hill, but with a George Mann image nonetheless.  <span></span>This is the Sentous Block, designed in 1886 by R. J. Reeve; the same year Reeve designed the <a href="http://digitallibrary.usc.edu/assetserver/controller/view/search/CHS-8310" title="USHotel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U. S.

</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--><!--[endif]-->Louis Sentous was one of the great <a href="http://www.skyscrapercity.com/showthread.php?t=367672" title="FrenchPios" target="_blank" rel="noopener">French pioneers</a> of Los Angeles who‘d arrived penniless, panned for a little gold and became a successful cattle rancher, trading meat and dairy at the Plaza until he bought the nearby piece of property (bounded by Sunset, Spring, Main and Macy) that was to bear his name.<o:p></o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--><!--[endif]-->The Sentous Block is best known around noirsville as where Mike Hammer cruises over to the Jalisco Hotel in <i>Kiss Me Deadly</i>; it also contained the Bamba Club, which doubles as the Round-Up in <i>Criss Cross</i>.<span>  </span>(Both on the Spring St. side of the Sentous; our image shows the Main St. side.)<span>  </span>For more than you would ever want to know about this, go <a href="http://forum.skyscraperpage.com/showthread.php?p=4852728" title="noirsville" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> <span></span>(seems like contributor Beaudry needs a girlfriend or something).

<p class="MsoNormal">
But on to Bunker Hill!
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
Ah, the Astoria.

<p class="MsoNormal">

</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
Nothing says deep arcaded entry and red-tiled bell tower like “Astoria”.<span>  </span>Yes, one can not help but marvel at the incongruity of Bunker Hill naming systems.<span>  </span>I wrote earlier in OBH about the red-tiled onion domed <i>Minnewaska</i>, the fairly Franco-Renaissance <i>Sherwood</i>, and while it hasn‘t been explored yet, the decisively Mission-styled 1904 Mission Apartments at Second and Olive spent much of its young life known as, of course, Castle Craig.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--><!--[endif]-->Astoria, the Greek word for quail, is also the part of Queens known for being full of Greeks.  <span></span>That notwithstanding, at the time of its construction, <i>Astoria</i><span style="font-style: normal"> connoted the Astoria, Queens that was then the “Hollywood of the East.”<span>  </span>Plus it had been named for John Jacob Astor.<span>  </span>All sorts of cachet.<span>  </span>Perhaps the developers thought that despite the arches and fauxdobe, the rather otherwise traditional use of the bay windows prevented naming the structure something vaguely Missiony like “Ramona Hotel” or “PortolÃ  Apts.</span><span style="font-style: normal">” </span>
</p>
<p>In any event, of the Astoria much <a href="/theAstoria" title="lifeanddeath" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has been said</a>. <br />
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--><!--[endif]-->Next to the Astoria is the 1916 Blackstone Apartments, with the nice Beaux Arts garlands upon‘t.<span>  </span>Not a whole lot happened there, an ex-cop caught violating the Wright Act,<span> </span>and there were some lady bootleggers; while the Widows Protective League Los Angeles Branch Council met at the Blackstone, a widow took poison and offed herself there the very same year (1929); and Ross Page, younger brother of the widely-known <a href="http://www.insroland.org/farmerpage" title="FahmaPage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Farmer” Page</a>, was busted there by the vice squad while running two bridge games and a poker game in August of ”˜25.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
I will let Matt Weinstock of the <i>Times</i><span style="font-style: normal"> do the talking for me:</span>
</p>
<div align="justify">
</div>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">
<!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--><!--[endif]--><i>That din emanating from Bunker Hill these days is the relentless pounding of the jackhammers tearing down the ancient Blackstone Apartments, 244 S Olive St., next door to the top of Angel‘s Flight.</i>
</p>
<div align="justify">
</div>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">
<i>Until the demolition crew went to work on it, the Blackstone was nine stories high, counting the floors from the back entrance in the alley, which was kept locked.<span>  </span>However, if you entered on Olive St., as most people did, you were on the third floor, and from there it was only a six story building.<span>  </span>I learned this many years ago in visiting a departed colleague, <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/thedailymirror/2010/04/matt-weinstock-april-25-1960.html" title="JFBA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">J. Farrington Barrington Arrington</a>, who lived there.</i>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">
<i>And so another quaint landmark passes and now, when I go into a building on what purports to be the main floor it will really be the main floor, not the third.<span>  </span>Progress marches on.<br />

<p>Bunker Hill is a lost Los Angeles neighborhood, and On Bunker Hill is a memorial website that was born over the course of a year&#8217;s collaboration. The contributors followed their own particular obsessions down the historical rabbit hole, coming up with aspects of the community&#8217;s lore that were placed on a virtual map, so interested visitors could explore at their leisure.</p>
<p>Although On Bunker Hill is no longer being updated, people continue to discover the site and contribute their own insights and memories through the comment section. But occasionally, someone comes along who has something more to offer than a comment or a link, and so we bring the On Bunker Hill blog back to life for a brief moment, so this someone can take their rightful place among the ghosts.</p>
<p>Enter George Mann.<br />

<p>Born in Santa Monica in 1905, by his early 20s he was a vaudeville star as the hilariously taller half of the comedy dance team <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barto_and_Mann" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Barto &amp; Mann</a>. Dewey Barto [real name Dewey Smoyer and the pop of comedienne <a href="http://blog.wfmu.org/freeform/2007/12/365-days-338--.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nancy Walker</a>] and George debuted their act on the west coast circuit in 1926 and by March 1927 were featured on the other Broadway, at New York&#8217;s celebrated Palace Theatre.</p>
<p>Of their east coast debut, <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,740063,00.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>Zit&#8217;s Theatrical Newspaper</i></a> raved &#8220;Ten minutes before they went on at the Palace last Monday afternoon nobody thought very much about Barto &amp; Mann; ten minutes after they came off stage, the whole Broadway world was talking about them&#8230; Acts like these only come along once in a while.&#8221;<br />
<img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4053/4653170710_c9ba1e7084.jpg" /></p>
<p>Appearing at L.A.&#8217;s Orpheum in March 1928, they were praised in the <i>L.A. Times</i> as &#8220;a knockout team,&#8221; though their set at the Hillstreet the following month discomfited one reviewer: &#8220;The act presented by Barto &amp; Mann was one of those hectic affairs in which the participants did everything from a climb up the proscenium arch to a near-back-flip into the orchestra pit. The excellence of the dancing and clowning in the early portions of the act led one to expect a much more worthwhile finale than the one offered, which, unfortunately, bordered plainly on vulgarity.&#8221;</p>
<p>One man&#8217;s vulgarity is another&#8217;s hilarity: scope out this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWVojP9GDCc#t=03m39s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rare filmed appearance</a>, from the 1933 Texas Guinan vehicle &#8220;Broadway Through A Keyhole,&#8221; and decide for yourself!</p>
<p>As Vaudeville faded, Barto &amp; Mann joined the Broadway cast of Olson and Johnson&#8217;s <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brad_smith/4508325712/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>Hellzapoppin&#8217;</i></a> (though they&#8217;re not in the 1941 film), with featured billing from 1938 through 1942. The team split up in December 1943.</p>
<p>Around this time, George Mann married <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Robert_Powers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Powers Agency</a> model Barbara Bradford and shot a series of film noir-inspired images of his young bride.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4054/4653169438_97244123d9.jpg" /><br />

<p>In his post-performance life, George Mann turned his imagination to entrepreneurial enterprise and professional photography, which brought him to Bunker Hill. In the late 1950s, when the neighborhood&#8217;s days were known to be numbered, he arrived atop the peak with his camera to document some representative scenes, returning in November 1962 for additional shots.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4017/4652550351_073c879d74.jpg" /></p>
<p>These never-before-published color images of old Bunker Hill were originally displayed in 3-D viewers of Mann&#8217;s own design, which were leased to various Los Angeles businesses, including Hody&#8217;s Drive-Ins, and other restaurants, bars and doctor&#8217;s offices. Mann would swap out the photo selection regularly, so if these evocative scenes of Bunker Hill weren&#8217;t available, one might peep at Calico Ghost Town, Catalina Island, Descanso Gardens, Disneyland, Knott&#8217;s Berry Farm, Pacific Ocean Park, Watts Towers or Palm Springs.</p>
<p>In his 3-Dimensional Bunker Hill set, created to distract anxious patients and hungry tourists, George Mann captured a seldom seen side of this lost Los Angeles neighborhood: the gracious avenues and genteel decay, the old people, their cats and their gardens, abandoned newspapers, vacant lots, the shadows and the sunlight. We are in his debt.</p>
<p>George Mann died in 1977, and his extraordinary photographic archives are currently being organized, scanned and made available for licensing. We trust you will enjoy these rediscovered images from old Bunker Hill from the George Mann Archives.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A glance at mid-century America reveals it emblazoned with the familiar totems:  military might, industrial supremacy, cultural imperialism.  These were carved by fervent if not blind <i>progress</i>, and you‘d be given a funny look (if not worse) were you to dare question <i>that</i>.  </p>
<p>Nobody would dare bat an eye as freeways forever cut up cities, and huge swaths of our collective memory were lost to parking lots and well-intentioned developments.  Funny old buildings were the realm of <a href="/MunstersofBunkerHill" title="universalmutants" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mutants</a>, after all.</p>
<p>But even in the glory days of unquestioned, unfettered forward movement–before, say, Dallas ‘63 and Watts ‘65–there was a small rumbling of (not unpatriotic) discontent.  Landmarks were lost hand over fist but when in 1962 it came time for <a href="http://www.nyc-architecture.com/GON/GON004.htm" title="6-5000" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Penn Station</a> to become so much New Jersey Medowlands landfill, eyebrows were raised.  This was <i>Penn Station</i>, after all.  Somebody at <i>Life</i> magazine (somebody who ambled through Penn Station to the <i>Life</i> offices at Rockefeller Center, most likely) realized that losing our common heritage would make a nifty nine-page spread.  And so <i>Life</i> called upon heavyweight photojournalist <a href="http://www.getty.edu/art/gettyguide/artMakerDetails?maker=1634" title="WEsnapper" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Walker Evans</a> to do the immortalizing.</p>
<p>Walker shot in New York, as well as Norwalk, Conn; Boston and Amesbury, Mass; then out to California for Nevada City, San Francisco, and, in October of 1962, Los Angeles.  Where he made a beeline to Bunker Hill.  He shot all over the Hill but curiously took his greatest number of shots of 101 South Flower, and it was 101 South Flower that made it into the magazine:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3229/3087581193_894f6b9af5_o.gif" alt="FirstFlowerLife" height="553" width="250" /></p>
<p>What can be said of 101-109, aka 101-111 South Flower?  Precious little.  We know that it is announced in February of 1904, to run $16,000 ($364,809 USD 2007).</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3164/3087579775_8a94a883db_o.gif" alt="comingout" height="70" width="463" /></p>
<p>But a thorough check of its various addresses shows that nothing of consequence ever there occurred.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3242/3087579743_4390916b8e_o.gif" alt="towardfront" height="476" width="493" /></p>
<p>The southwest corner of First and Flower:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3036/3088419496_a4e6680a97_o.gif" alt="Sanborn" height="372" width="481" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3293/3088419530_4bfba53849_o.gif" alt="cliffthenogood" align="right" height="111" width="345" />Sure, there was the small matter of Clifford Gooding, who‘d married his gal Marie and had a daughter with her, only to disappear after a few years.  Marie heard Clifford was dead, and so she remarried, only Clifford wasn‘t dead, just”¦disappeared.  To Bunker Hill.  She lived down on 37th Street; Bunker Hill may as well be the moon.  After six years of Clifford being “deceased” she caught wind that he wasn‘t, had him tracked down, and he was popped at our First &amp; Flower apartment house in November 1925 on a deadbeat dad charge.  That‘s about as racy as it gets; that, and the residents of this particular place had a terrible habit of stepping off of this curb and that into fatally well-built oncoming automobiles.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3061/3088417426_34445e5492_o.gif" alt="101SFautos" height="471" width="486" /></p>
<p>Fortunately what we lack in drama we make up for in image quantity.  It was captured of course by the incomparable Arnold Hylen:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3233/3088417734_a49510c6d0_o.gif" alt="hylen101SF" height="373" width="575" /></p>
<p>Today, of course, the building is demolished, but one isn‘t always expecting to find the same thing to have happened to the <i>street</i>.  Where has all the Flower gone?</p>
<p>In each of the two images below:  First at the top, Second at the bottom, Figueroa at the left (yes, I know Fig is a Street and not an Avenue, that‘s Baists for you) Hope on the right.  In the top image, Flower runs down the middle, and there‘s 101 in orange, with “Labarere Tr.” (for Labarere Tract) written across it.  In the modern image below, well Flower just went away.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3249/3087581819_2868fa67f7_o.gif" alt="1926fighope" height="336" width="450" /><br />

This action is largely credited for impregnating America with preservation consciousness.  This <a href="http://www.preservationnation.org/magazine/2008/books/" title="noharmnofoul" target="_blank" rel="noopener">isn‘t true</a>, of course, but that‘s ok.</p>
<p>In writing about the Amesbury, Mass. <a href="http://www.historicnewengland.org/visit/homes/rocky.htm" title="RHMH" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rocky Hill Meeting House</a> <i>Life</i> notes that a proposed expressway is taking down three 18th-century buildings and coming within yards of the structure, which is in a state of <a href="http://www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/collection_database/objectview_altviewenlarge.aspx?page=51&amp;sort=3&amp;sortdir=asc&amp;keyword=&amp;fp=51&amp;dd1=0&amp;dd2=0&amp;vw=1&amp;collID=0&amp;OID=190037903&amp;vT=1&amp;iID=15&amp;iPage=2" title="holyholy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">miraculous state</a> of preservation.  This writer does not know if the 1963 worries about blasting and vibrations undermined the building, or played havoc with the 1780s glazing, but I do know that the 495 is now a stone‘s throw away, and I call that wrong.  </p>

After a three-year battle, citizens saved the mansion by referendum; the city ignored this and set out to build the city hall on the mansion grounds <i>again</i>.

<p>And so while the vast majority of the subjects in <i>Life</i>‘s article survived to see another millennium, 101 South Flower did not.  Nor did any of the any other structures shot by Evans that Los Angeles October.</p>
