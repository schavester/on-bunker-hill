<p>May 22, 1930</p>
<p>William J. Stone, 38, was a Bostonian broker who&#8217;d moved to Los Angeles and into the Casa Alta Hotel and Apartments, 317 South Olive. In what may have partly been a case of Don”™t Argue with a Janitor, or partly No-One Likes a Broker in 1930, Stone managed to get into a regrettable debate with the Casa Alta janitor, one Walter Dixon.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3338/3252852534_f77125a16f_o.gif" width="309" height="87" alt="hatchetwielder"></p>

<p>The argument climaxed in Dixon taking a hatchet to Stone”™s head and chasing him from the building. Stone wound up in Georgia Street Receiving Hospital with severe skull lacerations, but lived to broker–or, not–another day, and Dixon landed in the stir on suspicion of ADW.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3314/3252849014_4ab6b12b8b_o.gif" width="575" height="362" alt="palace"></p>
<p>Here”™s everything you didn”™t know you needed to know about 317 S. Olive, aka The Kellogg, aka the Palace, aka the Casa Alta.</p>
<p>First of all, there are few photos of the place.  Pity the poor Palace.  It was too large and utilitarian to merit the lens of a Reagh or Hylen.  Sure, everybody shot its neighbor, the Ems, and in nearly every Ems image, there”™s the Great Wall of Alta looming in the background:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3531/3254591232_2331f30687_o.gif" width="423" height="400" alt="Ems1909"></p>
<p>(Don&#8217;t look at the Ems.  Look at the building behind it.  We&#8217;ll talk about the Ems next week, I promise.)</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3114/3254591284_6ba2029879_o.gif" width="318" height="245" alt="WalkerEvansEms1960"></p>
<p>Moreover, whenever one stood on the corner of Third and Olive, the temptation was apparently too great to turn one”™s back on the Kellogg/Palace/Casa Alta and shoot the <a href="http://jpg1.lapl.org/pics18/00008529.jpg" target="_blank" title="upperterminus">upper terminal of Angels Flight</a>. </p>
<p>Before the advent of 317, it was 315 S. Olive, which was ground zero for the <a href="/burningbush" target="_blank" title="onamountofolives">Burning Bushers</a>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3447/3253802081_4971299508_o.gif" width="334" height="384" alt="sanborn1906"></p>
<p>Then came the seven-story, 84-apartment Kellogg.  It opens in April, 1908.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3443/3252900260_ea8fb766f1_o.gif" width="429" height="98" alt="openingad"></p>

<p>Almost immediately it becomes the Palace Hotel and Apartments; the image at the top of this post, where it&#8217;s proudly emblazoned Palace Hotel, is from a card postmarked 1910.</p>
<p>Looking up Olive, ca. 1915:  the most prominent, in ascending order, the <a href="/Auditorium/SanCarlosHotel" target="_blank" title="AudSanCarl">Auditorium</a>, the <a href="/hoteltrenton" target="_blank" title="Trentony">Trenton</a>, the <a href="/taxonomy/term/372" target="_blank" title="HailFremontia">Fremont</a>, and at top, the Palace:</p>

<p>In 1926 the owner puts it out to lease–it is snatched up and becomes the Casa Alta (they have cleverly renamed this rather tall house &quot;tall house,&quot; but in <i>Spanish</i>!).  </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3091/3252028261_2425dc387b_o.gif" width="349" height="63" alt="1926leaseme"></p>
<p>The 1929 City Directory:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3301/3252857704_87a29332c4_o.gif" width="444" height="111" alt="casaaltadirectory29"></p>

<p>Here”™s what we glean from this 1939 census report: the Casa, faced in brick, has 72 apartments (ok, so the Sanborn Map says 84) in its seven floors, and no business units. There”™s no basement. It was built in 1906, though that doesn&#8217;t exactly jive with its April 08 opening date. A nice two-room unit will set you back $27.50 ($406.55 USD 2007), still pretty cheap, but the Hill had begun its downturn even by 1939. Slouching toward shabby though it may have been, nevertheless, that rent was for a furnished apartment, and included heat, water, and electricity.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3353/3253821533_8b0d559720_o.gif" width="575" height="360" alt="1939casacensus"></p>
<p>The 1956 City Directory:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3346/3254677284_4366c9b019_o.gif" width="400" height="397" alt="56directory"></p>
<p>&#8230;quite a few folk in the 72 apartments had ”˜phones. Two basement apartments, an office, eighteen tenants had the device. For Bunker Hill, that might have been some sort of record.</p>
<p>By 1965, there were fewer.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3485/3253859019_94eba42e5a_o.gif" width="400" height="250" alt="deathkiss65"></p>
<p>And that&#8217;s the last time it appears in the directories.  </p>
<p>Here it is as one of the lone survivors, in its final days, ca. 1967.  Angels Flight hangs on until 1969.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3488/3252900262_eb24ddfdb5_o.gif" width="381" height="308" alt="lookingupatthebeast"></p>
<p>The Palace of Casa Kellogg, and its events of eventful eventfulness:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3078/3253912575_4c1a69f213_o.gif" width="200" height="190" align="right" alt="blinky">In 1914, the Palace Hotel was where fancy ladies with big diamonds lived. Therefore, of course, sharps and cons knew where to prey.  But Lillian Walker was ingrained with common sense and uncommon suspicions.  Despite the big car with its monogrammed door, from which stepped the elegantly dressed man and woman who came to her apartment, despite their discourse about rare gems they”™d purchased in the orient, and their winter home in Santa Barbara, Mrs. Walker <i>just doesn”™t trust people who blink rapidly when they talk</i>.  The man, who called himself Mullins, eagerly wrote her a fat check for a big diamond, but Mrs. Walker, seeing his blinky eye, said no.  She took a $25 check for a small gem, and agreed to meet later to discuss further sales.  She immediately verified her suspicions–the checks were false, and Lillian called the authorities–but the grifters got wise to the ambush set for them, and evaded being captured in the Palace.</p>

Florence Cheney”™s daughter, Margaret Emery, had <i>her</i> deposition taken at her Palace Hotel sickbed.</p>
<p>Margaret testified that Maude Kennedy had been in a fine and jovial mood until very shortly before her death, lending weight to the argument that she committed suicide (Tugwell eventually served ten years in Quentin for manslaughter).</p>

She had been despondent ever since having departed Richmond, VA for Los Angeles; the best course of action, decided Katherine, was to eat bichloride of mercury tablets in their Palace apartment. The physicians at Receiving Hospital fixed her up just enough to try another Christmas.</p>

<p>We”™re all aware that every so often, people sometimes <a href="http://www.1947project.com/wanderlustatsea" target="_blank" title="theBorg"><i>just up and go missing</i></a>.  Dr. Harold E. Roy was a prominent New York dentist whose crushed canoe was found in the Hudson River (it was assumed he was torn asunder by a paddle steamer); his widow moved to Los Angeles and into the Palace Apartments. Then, a year later, in February 1922, a lowly workman at the Kansas City Union Station realized, hey, I”™m a dead New York dentist.  Where”™s my wife?  <img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3098/3252026381_946f37d46e_o.gif" width="495" height="212" alt="deadayear">He tracks her down through her family and shows up on the Palace doorstep, and she has to give back $10,000 ($122,730 USD2007) to Bankers Life Insurance Company.</p>

<p>The Palace Hotel/Casa Alta was also the center of political activity for rebel rousers from Riga.  Through the late 20s the papers were peppered with small notices about, for example, the precise method of sending packages to Latvia, and if you had further questions, contact the Latvian Consulate–317 S. Olive.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3506/3252027577_89d4ac19db_o.gif" width="241" height="102" align="right" alt="defied!">Now, Ethel M. Rising had a thing or two to say about marrying into Baltic bliss.  She divorced her husband, H. R. Rising, left him in the Casa Alta, and the State awarded her $50 a month from H. R. to support their two daughters. But with that dictate Mr. Rising did not comply.  Ethel complained to the City Prosecutor, who hauled Rising into court, October 2, 1928.  There declared Rising:  “I have been appointed Vice-Consul for Latvia and your courts have no jurisdiction over me.”&#157;  The court conferred with the District Attorney and Rising was, in fact, correct.  One can only imagine he threw back his head and added a hearty Latvian <i>bwa-ha-ha-ha!</i></p>

George McRoy, 31, was spraying the Casa Alta with insecticide–and nearly went to exterminator Elysium, but ended up at Georgia Street Receiving.   </p>

Blumie climbed to the top of the Casa Alta, December 1, 1935, and leapt to his death.</p>

<p>Two items were found in her pocketbook–a letter asking that her nephew be notified, and her eviction notice.</p>

<p>We may never know.  All we know is that she was recently reconciled with her estranged husband, Willid Thompson.  After two years she had returned to him, and for the past two weeks she and he were in domestic bliss at 317 S. Olive.  That was, until, April 16, 1948.</p>
<p>Beatrice and Black knew each other from their place of employ, she a waitress, he a cook, at a downtown restaurant.  </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3095/3252852744_be88be5279_o.gif" width="202" height="114" align="left" alt="hamicide">The pair boarded an LA Transit Lines car at 11th and Broadway, and for a while argued in low tones.  She was against the window, sobbing, and muttering “Leave me alone, please leave me alone.”&#157;  When she rose to leave at 4th and Broadway, Black pushed her back in the seat and shot her four times.  Also on the car was James F. Patrick, Special Officer, Metro Division, who pulled his piece and handcuffed Black at gunpoint, during which Black pleaded “Shoot me, please shoot me.”&#157;  </p>
<p>The Thompson killing by Black, who was black, gets surprisingly little press. Perhaps the concept that this interracial killing was presaged by an interracial love affair meant that propriety demanded ignorance.</p>

The two hotels also have cranky boilers. The Central tried to blow itself up in November 1953; the year before, in November 1952, the Casa Alta boiler felt the hands of Frank Dauterman, 43, tinkering within its works.  So the boiler blew itself up, failing to kill Dauterman or take down the Alta, but sending Dauterman to Georgia Street with second and third degree burns to his head, chest and arms.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A month later, December 20, 1952, residents heard screams from the apartment of Willie Kohl, 79.  His apartment was aflame; he was found on the floor near the bed, and died en route to Georgia Street.</p>
<p>Kohl&#8217;s conflagration is the Casa Alta&#8217;s final appearance in the <i>Times</i>.  The remaining tenants are relocated in the late 60s and it soon becomes a tall pile of brick.</p>

<p>Corner of Fourth and Olive, August 29, 1962.</p>
<p>Van R. Alexanian, 23, was loading a barrel of rubbish into the scoop on the front of his trash-truck when the parking brake gave way.  The truck ran into an electrical pole, and the live wire caught the truck debris on fire.  The pole then fell onto a Mrs. Helen Stairs, 50.</p>
<p>The flaming truck went on to take out a traffic signal and a lamp post before crashing into a garage.  This much was fortunate; the garage attendant was equipped with a fire extinguisher.</p>

<p>
Officer L. S. Rasic commented that had the truck continued through the intersection, it would have crashed into eight cars waiting for the signal to change.</p>
<p>The question remains as to what garage the garbage truck plowed into, as there were in fact three at Olive and Fourth:  the 1923 Mutual Garage at the NE corner, the 1919 Hotel Clark/Center Garage at the SE corner, and the 1923 Savoy Garage at the SW corner.  Here&#8217;s a picture of all three, 1966:</p>

The 600-car Mutual at left in the image above is now the foundation for <a href="http://www.you-are-here.com/los_angeles/californiaplaza.html" title="CP2" target="_blank">Cal Plaza Two</a>.  The Hotel Clark Garage, center (along with that tall white building, ironically named the <a href="http://jpg1.lapl.org/pics26/00032547.jpg" title="larryjew" target="_blank">Black Building</a>) is still an empty lot, site of what was to be <a href="http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Confusion+greets+Three+Cal+Plaza+default+notice,+some+see+union+tie-a013927656" title="C3PO" target="_blank">Cal Plaza Three</a>.

Mrs. Emma Rupe was fixated on <i>being</i> a mother.  So much so that on July 5, 1936, the Denver waitress took a fancy to John, the two year-old son of Mr. and Mrs. John Richard O”™Brien.  John, it seems, looked just like Emma”™s own toddler who”™d died nine years previous.  On the pretext that she was going to take the little darling out to buy him a playsuit (the O”™Briens being trusting souls, and near penniless, so how could they refuse?) Emma thereupon took John shopping”¦as far from Denver as she could get, and with as great a chance of disappearing as possible.  Because clichés are born of truth, noir clichés especially, she beelined straight for Los Angeles, Bunker Hill specifically, and checked into the St. Regis.</p>
<p>

<p>
For ten weeks the FBI combed the States until they were tipped off by an acquaintance of Emma”™s, and on September 19 the Feds descended on 237 South Flower.  Emma, 30, was pulled from the St. Regis hysterical and weeping; the boy, whom she called “Jackie,”&#157; appeared impassive.  Emma Rupe broke down again when a Denver jury gave her twenty to life.</p>

Much in the way a French Renaissance building might be dubbed the Sherwood, this Missionesque structure is named after a French nobleman–<a href="http://content.stregis.org/parish/templates/info.aspx?articleid=892&amp;zoneid=73" title="theReg" target="_blank">J. F. Regis</a>, tireless converter of Huguenots, and advocate of lacemaking for wayward girls.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The St. Regis leads a fairly quiet life.  Other than the aforementioned FBI intrusion in 1936, there was the small matter of the coppers showing up to collect Elmer Hudson, 32, and his wife Betty, 20, in 1928.  When two bad guys held up a café at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=200+N+Dillon+St,+Los+Angeles,+Los+Angeles,+California+90057,+United+States&amp;sll=34.075039,-118.283315&amp;sspn=0.008727,0.013819&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;cd=1&amp;layer=c&amp;ll=34.078096,-118.281426&amp;spn=0.008726,0.013819&amp;z=16&amp;cbll=34.07374,-118.28216&amp;panoid=S1CP8ye7XYSpRibTsQ-_iQ" title="wink" target="_blank">200 Dillon Street</a> and made off with $300 ($3,554 USD2007), Betty made the mistake of not keeping her bad-guy self in the shadows.  Café owner C. V. Anderson recognized her as a former waitress.</p>
<p>What is it about these wayward gals–waitresses both–that can”™t keep their clutchy paws off money nor baby?  Maybe they”™ll learn some lacemaking in the pen.  Make St. Regis proud.</p>

The Bozwell Apartments (which seem to shoot for Greek Revival but, oddly, come off as Monterrey) next door at 245, abandoned, burn on May 22, 1962.</p>

<p>The blaze, reported the Times, was believed to have been “touched off by hobos.”&#157;</p>
<p>While firemen kept the conflagration from spreading to the St. Regis, its days were just as numbered as if it were the Bozwell itself.</p>
<p>For these were heady days:  the Lesser Festivals of Abandoment, The Princial Feasts of Official Neglect, and the Commemorations of Escalating Mysterious Fires.  Obligatory for the observant.</p>

		<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2254/2660612112_3f255d818e_o.gif" alt="Marcella" height="592" width="575">Today we discuss The Marcella, who once flaunted her classical order on Flower (she is Italian, please be advised the C in her name is not pronounced <i>s</i> as in <i>sell</i>, but like <i>ch</i> as in <i>chin</i>).  See how her name beckons, proud but not haughty, from her entablature?  She wants to take you in and protect you under that great cornice with her large corbels.  Despite her imposing presence, she is warm, and welcoming; the wide porches bespeak grace, and the timberframe vernacular on the bays coo <i>cozy by the fire lad, there”™s good feelings in mortise and tenon</i>.  </p>
<p>But don”™t speak of  fire.  Fire struck the Marcella in October of 1912, sending well-to-do ladies like Mrs. L. M. Harvey to Pacific Hospital after having leapt from upper stories.  Other occupants hustled (stricken with panic; see below) and scantily attired into the street.  Marcella owner C. F. Holland states he”™s looking at $3,000 ($65,983 USD2007) in damages, $2,000 to the rugs and furniture alone.  <br>
<img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3236/2660611730_dcbcdcb8cb_o.gif" alt="PanicStricken" height="141" width="526"><br>
It is reported that a man was seen running from the building a few minutes before the fire broke out.  The storeroom, where the fire began, was not locked.  The mystery is never solved but Marcella, stout of bay and stalwart of column, cannot be burned away.  She perseveres.<br>
<img loading="lazy" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2001/2660612342_da8059f7d9_o.gif" alt="Cometomother" height="820" width="575"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Marcella is a building so lovely she attracts only the comeliest of patrons.  She is home to Miss May Long, a lass so fetching that when in May of 1913 she turned her attentions to one Earl G. Horton, he is gunned down by another suitor outside of his apartment house near <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=1129+W+Temple+St,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90012&amp;sll=34.068214,-118.251193&amp;sspn=0.00855,0.013304&amp;layer=c&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=34.067841,-118.251235&amp;spn=0.00855,0.013304&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr&amp;cbll=34.063953,-118.25192&amp;panoid=GHaKiWGCNCAnGNrIWbCV1Q" title="shooting" target="_blank">Temple &amp; Victor</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jealousy over a woman causes upset <i>again</i> at the Marcella on October 25 of 1922 when Emergency Patrolman Claude Coffrin went to visit Mrs. Tillie Smith in her Marcella apartment.  Not long after Coffrin&#8217;s ingress, there appeared Emergency Patrolman Anthony Kazokas and a civilian, Joe Cummins.  Kazokas had loaned Cummins his revolver and badge to settle his romantic score with Coffrin over Tillie.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3222/2661876479_09a095e2ae_o.gif" alt="nothingbuttroubleItellya" height="117" width="488"></p>
<p>Coffrin and Cummins fought, and Coffrin gained control of the gun; he phoned the Detective Bureau and over came officers Nickens and Ellis.  Cummins at that point grabbed the gun back from Coffrin and stuck it in Nickens”™ side, and Patrolman Kazokas jumped on Detective Ellis.  Ellis brained Kazokas out cold with the butt of his gun, but Nickens ended up shooting Cummins through the neck.  </p>
<p>The lovely Mrs. Smith was arrested on violation of parole; she had been sentenced on the 18th to pay $50 and spend thirty days in jail–suspended–for “social vagrancy”&#157;.  Apparently, quality of young lady was beginning to decline at the Marcella.<br>
<img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3207/2659783783_d34bd5730f_o.jpg" alt="marcellaad" height="39" width="267"><br>
Other upstanding members of society to grace the Marcella”™s rooms were the Jacksons, of whom you read all about <a href="/node/118" title="NISA" target="_blank">here</a>. <br>
<img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3192/2661937757_978aa42f59_o.gif" alt="TheJackson2" height="335" width="459"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And remember <a href="/iwantolive" title="idont" target="_blank">Barbara Graham</a>?  What helped send Barbara to the chair was hubby Henry”™s testimony on the witness stand.  Her last-ditch alibi was that she and Henry were together that night of March 9, 1953–but Henry testified he had already moved out and was living with his mother”¦at the Marcella.  (A mere two blocks down from the Lancaster, scene of Baxter Shorter&#8217;s abduction.)</p>
<p>Little Tommy Graham, now five, was living in the Marcella in 1957 when Wanger Pictures gave him $1000 for filming his executed mother”™s life story.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fire again struck the Marcella, this time in 1962, and this time it meant business.  On March 30 a blaze razed the upper two stories of the structure.  Twelve fire units quelled the blaze in half an hour; She of 223 South Flower vanished from memory soon afterward.</p>
<p>Here we are looking north on Flower through the intersection of Third, 1965.  See the little Victorian, left center?  The Marcella was just on the other side of that.<br>
<img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3091/2660612482_6fe71a9943_o.gif" alt="UpFlower" height="410" width="575"><br>
Today Flower Street makes a sharp turn between Third and Second to avoid the Bunker Hill Towers.  The Marcella stood just on the other side of this pool:</p>

<p>Interesting, and, what, perhaps a little unnerving, but certainly instructive, to consider that the image that began this post, and the one immediately above, were taken from the same spot.</p>

Bentz–nephew of M. W. Connor, owner–was in the office when stifling fumes and a dense cloud of smoke began to rise from the floor. He dashed down the stairs and into the basement where, in smoke so dense he nearly suffocated, managed at great length to extinguish the conflagration. Bentz discovered newspapers wadded up between the beams, blackened and scorched.</p>
<p>Bentz and Connor went searching through the house, cellar to garret, for some sign of a stranger, and were about to give up when the office <i>again</i> filled with smoke. Again there was a dash to the basement”¦nothing. This time the smokey cloud was emerging from the elevator shaft. San Bernardino papers (<i>aha</i>!) were extracted, smoldering, from between wooden beams therein. This time Bentz and Connor summoned the authorites.</p>
<p>Good thing, too, for as Sgt. Hartmeyer approached the Melrose, he saw smoke billowing from the structure”¦two alarms were sent to the fire department, a door and several windows were broken open, and a large clothes basket, filled with paper, blazing furiously, was doused.</p>
<p>No-one ever found out who the immolator of South Grand was, or what it was they were after. (Whether burning the Melrose inspired Kimberly to firebomb Melrose Place at the end of Season Three is a question, alas, for Darren Star.)<br>
<img loading="lazy" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2292/2497763107_f32199d402_o.gif" alt="melrosein1940" width="324" height="400"><br>
The original Melrose Hotel, 130 South Grand, was a thirty-room, five-story structure built by Marc W. Connor (on what was then called Charity Street) in the summer of 1889. Its architect was Joseph Cather Newsom.  It was a center of fashionable goings-on, and society spectacle, and place of repose for honorable peoples.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3039/2497950773_33044c534c_o.gif" alt="melroseca95" width="575" height="453"></p>
<p>(The house in the foreground, 142 S. Grand, is the Robert Larkins residence, which became the Richelieu Hotel ca.1890.)</p>
<p>In early 1902 Connor erected the far more box-like Melrose Hotel, its architect Thomas J. McCarthy, at 120 just to the west of his cupola”™d wonder, which became its annex, connected to the hotel proper by an arcade.<br>
<img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3073/2498903278_d32944b671_o.gif" alt="melrose1911" width="575" height="360"></p>
<p>The dual Melroses persevered, all ornate of railing and careful of mitering, through the decline of, well, just about everything. By 1957, time had run out for the Melrose (one could say that Melrose place had been, if you will, canceled).</p>

<p>There wasn”™t anything left now but for little old ladies to amble by and mutter “oh, dear”&#157; and reminisce “I remember as if it were yesterday–the time President McKinley came to Los Angeles. We all came down and crowded around on the sidewalk–right here, right on this very spot–and listened while he made a speech from the front porch”¦”&#157;</p>

Here, Mrs. Mary Connor Rasche, whose father Marc W. built the Melrose, poses before her father&#8217;s legacy some weeks before its demolition. (<i>What&#8217;s that</i> lurking in the background?

<p>And so, it being 1957, the Melrose had to go.</p>

“One of the wrecking crew workmen observed that it took more than a<br>
year to build but only eight hours of giant claw and four-ton sphere<br>
hammering to lay the once proud building to the ground.”&#157;</p>
<p>Ah, the March of Progress. One can hear it <a title="stompstomp" href="http://www.laweekly.com/news/news/westsiders-slam-villaraigosas-push-for-apartments-citywide/18845/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">goosestepping</a> along, even now.</p>

		<p>The Minnewaska, aka The Dome, played host to no small quantity of characters over the course of her life.  Over the course of this blog you”™ll be introduced to your fair share of them.  Here then is a brief introduction to this, their home.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2383/2363258642_cce2deb895_o.gif" alt="minnie1903" height="488" width="550"></p>
<p>Our first mention of the Minnewaska comes in the form of this notice regarding building permits, January 11, 1903:<br>
<img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3077/2363363716_11d9d7833d_o.jpg" alt="minniebldngpermit" align="middle" height="122" width="261"><br>
She is completed within the year and on December 20 described in the <i>Times</i> thusly:</p>
<div align="justify">
”¦recently completed by J M Shield on the southwest corner of Grand avenue and Second street”¦the location, only three blocks from Broadway and Second street, and near the highest point of Olive Heights, is one which is both desirable and commanding.<br>
The house is a four-story combination frame and cement structure with tower.<br>
Its foundation is a heavy brick wall imbedded in solid red gravel.  Very heavy dimension timbers were used as the owner contemplated adding two or more stories to the building at some time in the future.  The outer walls are covered with heavy diagonals and on this surface is placed steel lath and two coats of cement plaster.  The latter is tinted a delicate cream color, which gives the building a very pleasing exterior.
</div>
<div align="justify">
The interior is arranged in flats of two and four rooms each, which are supplied with private baths, marble-topped wash stands, electric bells, steam heat, and such other modern conveniences as are usually found in the best apartment hotels.<br>
The house contains 122 guests”™ rooms and thirty-seven bathrooms, besides dining-room, kitchen, storeroom, cold-storage and furnace rooms, office and reception-room.  The latter are finished in paneled oak and have decorated ceilings.<br>
The apartments are finished in white cedar, and are so arranged that each room can be entered from a hall.  The building could therefore be easily converted into a regular commercial hotel.<br>
Its main hall is arranged as an open court, and its roof garden affords a view of the surrounding country that extends from the mountains to the sea.<br>
The building cost about $65,000.  The lot on which it stands extends westward to Bunker Hill avenue and affords space for an extension to the present building that would give it a frontage of about 400 feet on the three streets and a total of 200 guests”™ rooms.
</div>
<p>Sold in 1905, the Minnewaska remains so named in the city directories until 1907, when she becomes, simply and more descriptively, the Dome.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2291/2364173105_d5591a86e5_o.gif" alt="domebigpic" height="551" width="400"></p>
<p>And sure, you&#8217;re to read here about all manner of shady and shifty character who occupied 201 South Grand during the Dome”™s heyday, but I”™ll delight most in telling you of Frank Babcock, one of the Dome”™s owners, the man who through the late 1950s took on the Community Redevelopment Agency in lawsuit after lawsuit pointing out, and correctly, that the CRA had no right to condemn the Hill&#8217;s habitable property and certainly not to use public money to do so (Babcock”™s theory that oil bigwig/CRA chairman William T. Sesnon Jr. was after Bunker Hill for its oil reserves is a bit fanciful, but is, in fact, backed up by the area”™s hydrocarbon geology–but all things in due time).</p>
<p>On the morning  of July 25, 1964, the Dome burst into flame, and as mentioned by Richard <a href="/Minnewaska" title="minnieburns" target="_blank">here</a>, there”™s been some question as to just how and why the Dome, most prominent and distantly visible of the Bunker Hill structures, burned.  While there had been some land purchases and building demolitions, despite the CRA”™s inception in 1948, they had by 1964 accomplished very little.  Was the burning of the Dome a &quot;push&quot; in the &quot;right direction&quot;?  (After Mayor Yorty called for an audit of the agency”™s redevelopment techniques, it was determined in 1966 that the CRA used shoddy business practices to achieve limited progress, despite simple goals that, according to a report four months in the making, myopically favored bulldozers over rehabilitation and conservation.)<br>

Conspiracies aside, she burns, her cremains removed and scattered to the four winds:<br>

“&#8230;will give way to a parking lot until the renewal project gets under way.”&#157;  She”™s been a parking lot since October 1964:<br>

The Disney Hall and Colburn School (right and bottom) are new additions; on the left is the 1989 Grand Promenade Apartments, which, judging by the <a href="http://www.apartmentratings.com/rate/CA-Los-Angeles-Grand-Promenade-Tower.html" title="lessthangrand" target="_blank">reviews</a>, certainly indicates the CRA did a great job.</p>
<p>Forty-four years as a parking lot but not, perhaps, forever, given this hint from the planning department regarding the tract: <br>

&#8230;and so on.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This is the famous Minnewaska Hotel which sat at the corner of 3rd &amp; Grand.  On July 26th, 1964 fire engulfed the venerable old building, which hosted 63 units.  The open central stairway was blamed on the blaze which spread like a blowtorch, killing one tenant and injuring six others.</p>
<p>Slated for demolition in 1967, it was rumored that the fire was intentionally started to stir up support for quicking the rehabilitation of the hill, which was simply another way of hastening it&#8217;s complete demolition to make way for commercial buildings which fit into the CRA (Community Redevelopment Agency)&#8217;s agenda.</p>
