										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By 1952, most of the lovely Melrose Hotel&#8217;s 200 occupants were elderly pensioners &#8212; elderly pensioners with exciting, glamorous, Auntie Mame-esque pasts.</p>
<p>First there&#8217;s the Melrose Hotel&#8217;s parttime switchboard operator, Anna Pearce, a former singer on the Considine vaudeville circuit around the turn of the century.</p>
<p>The hotel is also home to Juliet de Grazi, a Swahili-speaking Austrian-born soprano who toured with a Belgian opera company through the cities of East Africa.  In 1952, de Grazi was simply passing<br />
through the Melrose.  She had recently won a large settlement in an automobile accident, and was planning to return to East Africa where her husband was buried.</p>
<p>And Beulah Monroe was a fixture on the local theatre scene, making her debut in Oscar Wilde&#8217;s <i>The Ideal Husband</i> in 1919, opposite <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Everett_Horton" title="norton" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Edward Everett Horton</a>.  She appeared frequently at the Little Theatre at Figueroa and Pico, and also acted with Florence Roberts, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallace_Beery" title="beery" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wallace Beery</a>, and Neely Edwards during her career.</p>
<p>For more on <a href="/burnmelroseburn" title="melrose" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Melrose</a> and <a href="/girlswannahavefun" title="girls">its exciting inhabitants</a>, take a look at what Joan and Nathan have had to say about mysterious fires, rowdy teen girls, and the tragic march of progress.</p>
