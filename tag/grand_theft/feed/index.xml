<img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3127/2639345153_b9cdda411d_o.gif" alt="DomeupGrand" height="555" width="386" />After our initial report on <a href="/theDome" title="theDome" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Dome</a>, we promised there‚Äòd be more, and there was‚Äìthe <a href="/DomeDenizenSmith" title="DomeSmith" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Little BGirl Who Could</a>, a <a href="/sickmanjumps" title="sickojump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">couple</a> of <a href="/palominojumps" title="jumpingpalomino" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jumpers</a>,  a self-slashing <a href="/DomeiteBrannon" title="BrannonSimons" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Simons pilferer</a>, even the <a href="/duelingbabcocks" title="RadioFrank" target="_blank" rel="noopener">owner of the Dome itself</a>, who Fought the Power like an Eisenhower-era Radio Raheem, rolling his Grafanola down Grand‚Äù¬¶</p>
<p>‚Äù¬¶so now it‚Äòs time to sew things up, recounting a collection of other Dome-flavored contretemps:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3188/2639344771_89d3266cbc_o.gif" alt="CookFight" align="left" height="172" width="227" /><b><br />
April 7, 1940</b>.  Mike Scaiola, 29, and Rocco Spagnuolo, 35, both cooks, were roomies at the Dome. Over what they argued in their Domeroom is lost to time; all that‚Äòs known is what Scaiola later told the cops‚Äìduring a scuffle he saw the .32 automatic protruding from Spagnuolo‚Äòs shirt and attempted to wrest it from him.  Oldest story in the world:  accidental discharge, someone takes one in the chest, and Spagnuolo‚Äòs DOA at Georgia Street Receiving.  </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3032/2640171664_4b3a38e1ba_o.gif" alt="jackiejailed" align="right" height="180" width="216" /><b><br />
September 18, 1941</b>.  Mrs. Cleo (Jackie) Wooten, 19, was a plucky gal, but take this as a warning:  having pluck in spades gets the FBI involved.  Cleo was visiting friends in Cunningham, Kan. for some time and was there driving the car owned by Eddie Palzo of that city.  He had no objection to her driving the car around Cunningham, but swore out a felony complaint when the Dome resident decided to Dome home.  She was picked up at Third and Figueroa when an officer noticed the license on his stolen car list. </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3058/2639476665_d10268e4e7_o.gif" alt="JoeSlasher" align="left" height="199" width="217" /><b><br />
July 4, 1942</b>.  The character of Dome resident Joe Barron, 28, cook (another cook?  Too many cooks really do spoil the pot), did not reflect well on the Dome‚Äòs nobility.  He was strolling down Fifth Street and passed between one William O. Smith, 37, and Smith‚Äòs 21 year-old wife Dorothy when he elected to make an off-color remark to the wife.  That didn‚Äòt go over well with Mr. Smith, a recent transplant from Arkansas, who slashed Barron‚Äòs throat, severing an artery.  Luckily, Dorothy instructed William to press his thumb on the artery to stanch the flow of blood, and they hauled Barron into a room at 107 E. Fifth until medical aid could be summoned.  Barron survived, we trust, wiser and more gentelmanly.</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3095/2639344229_08665c444d_o.gif" alt="LeonasPurse" align="right" height="102" width="172" /><b><br />
December 21, 1942</b>.  Mrs. Leona Smith was followed home from a caf√É¬© last November 7, only to have her purse snatched‚Äìa purse containing $1600 in cash and checks and $4800 worth of jewelry ($6400=$89,216 USD2007).  After a month of searching by cops based on Leona‚Äòs description of the man and his car, they finally popped Clifford Allen Payne, 32, at the Dome.  He took them to the 3500 block of Helms in Culver where he dug up a glass jar containing the checks and jewelry.  The real mystery is what she was doing with that sort of booty in her purse.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3259/2640171574_f87b21c32f_o.gif" alt="afbarshoot" align="left" height="62" width="204" /><b>March 11, 1961</b>.  Alfred Carrillo, 33, was a Dome resident in good standing who had the bad luck to be sitting in a bar at 301 South Hill Street one early Friday morning.  Victor F. Jimenez, 26, unemployed truck driver, shot Alfred and then drove off, later to be arrested at his home.  (The bar at 301 South Hill, by the way, was the bar at the base of Angels Flight‚Äìseen here with Lon Chaney Jr. in the 1956 outing <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/indestructible_man" title="IM" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>Indestructible Man</i></a><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="üôÇ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>
That‚Äòs what we have for now.  Can‚Äòt promise it‚Äòs the last of it, as tales and details may still bubble up from the cracked core of time.  What about you?  Remember your great aunt Nell?  The one you socked away at Shady Pines?  (The rest home, not the cemetery.)   She may harbor descriptions of devious Dome debauchery from back in the day.  Go find out before you have to shift Shady Pines.</p>

Edna Brown, aka Edna Chaplin, aka Mabel Austin, seemed like such a nice girl. Sure, she‚Äù<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="‚Ñ¢" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />d been busted by Detective Sergeants Bartley and Allen for stealing $100<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'"><span>¬†</span>($1,271.00 current USD)</span> from O. Johnson‚Äù<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="‚Ñ¢" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s apartment at 124 South Bunker Hill Avenue, but Edna did the right thing and confessed to the crime, resulting in her being charged with grand theft and larceny.
</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
When she appeared in Judge Hinshaw‚Äù<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="‚Ñ¢" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s court for her arraignment, she burst into tears and appeared to be so genuinely remorseful that Guy Eddy, an attorney who was present on another matter, came to her defense and made a motion to dismiss the case. Judge Hinshaw was also moved by the girl‚Äù<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="‚Ñ¢" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s tears, and since Deputy District Attorney Orme made no objections, Edna walked.
</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">

</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
Apparently none of the well meaning men in the courtroom ever thought to question why such a seemingly nice girl would have at least two known aliases.

<p style="margin: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
A few days following Edna‚Äù<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="‚Ñ¢" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s day in court, Detective Sergeants Bartley and Allen were on the trail of a girl who had been accused by J.S. Purdy of using his name to pass bad checks. Purdy told the cops he suspected a girl named Edna. When he was shown a photo of Edna Brown, he immediately identified her as the forger.¬†

Note to Guy Eddy, Esq., Deputy District Attorney Orme, and Judge Hinshaw ‚Äù‚Äú no good deed goes unpunished.</p>
