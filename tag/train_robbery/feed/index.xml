In fact, they”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />d already survived a shoot out with one posse, and it would take at least one more to bring them to justice. Due mainly to the support of people in the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:placename w:st="on">San Joaquin</st1:placename> <st1:placetype w:st="on">Valley</st1:placetype></st1:place>, both robbers had managed to evade the law. Southern Pacific Railroad had cut a ruthless swath through <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:state w:st="on">California</st1:state></st1:place>, displacing people and gobbling up their land, so when Evans and Sontag struck out at the much despised company, people cheered. <br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><em><img loading="lazy" border="0" width="240" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3106/2759730283_9c45c04341_m.jpg" alt="sontag death" height="153" /></em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"><em>John Sontag near death as posse looks on.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt">Neither children nor Pinkerton Detectives ended up capturing Evans and Sontag. On May 28, 1893, the bandits were surrounded by a posse of local lawmen, and a furious gun battle ensued. Both men were wounded. Sontag died of his injuries, but Evans managed to escape. He came upon the home of Mrs. Parsons, who invited him in, and then dressed his wounds and put him to bed. Evans knew that his career as a train robber had ended, and he agreed to let Mrs. Parsons turn him in to the law if she would agree to split the reward she received with his wife ”“ which she promptly did. <br />
</span><span style="font-size: 11pt"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"></span><span style="font-size: 11pt">While Evans was awaiting trial, his wife and daughter were contacted by a <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on">San Francisco</st1:city></st1:place> theater company. The girls were offered money to appear as themselves in a production about one of the train robberies. Both mother and daughter agreed, putting the money they”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />d earned in a defense fund for Chris.<span>  </span>It was to no avail however, and Evans was sentenced to prison for life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt"></span><span style="font-size: 11pt"><img loading="lazy" border="0" width="345" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3091/2759730263_79dcd6c15c.jpg" alt="evans playbill" height="500" /></span></p>

Evans managed to escape from jail before he could be transported to Folsom Prison. <span> </span>After a brief taste of freedom, he was recaptured. Evans served his time and was released in 1911. He died in a state hospital a few weeks later.</span></p>
