The two collared ringleaders were on their way to the station house when one of the youngsters tucked a lock of long hair under his capâ€¦he being Miss Juanita Stuart, fourteen, of the Rossmere.  She protested tearfully when her mother was instructed by officers to burn the costume of khaki trousers, flannel shirt and boyâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s sweater, and to keep the young lady attired in feminine apparel only thereafter.</p>
<p><b>July 1, 1927.</b>  William Barrett, Rossmerian, had been arrested at the hotel by officers on Volstead violations and entered into evidence was one large bottle of gin.  At Barrettâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s trial the prosecuting attorney sought to clinch a conviction by producing said bottle, but, like a reversed wedding at Cana, a police property room at LAPD will turn gin into water.  </p>

<p>Barrett went back to the Rossmere a free man, thankful to the police for working a miracle.</p>

Bitters, 82, a former shoplifter by trade, decided on September 5 of this year to stop eating.  The fourteen-year resident of the Rossmere simply found life â€œno longer worth living,â€ which is reasonable enough (moreover recently-assassinated Gandhi had made fasting fashionable).  But Bitters was descended upon by members of the Community Chest and the Salvation Armyâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Golden Agers Club, who bundled him up and trundled him off to General Hosptial for psychiatric examination.  </p>

Elena Bravo had warned her little Martha, seven, against playing on the third floor fire escape, but Martha didnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t listen and tumbled off, only to be caught by Mrs. Max Casadosâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ground-floor clothesline.  The child suffered a compound arm fracture, a less lamentable situation than another hotel would have afforded.</p>

Morales, 28, delivered a benediction of blood to six of his sleeping children.  And after his sprinkler-like artery-opening anointing act, he beat down a door and chased his wifeâ€”she carrying their nine-month-old babyâ€”and her parents into the street outside the Rossmere with a butcher knife.  When the cops finally arrived at First and Hope they found Morales inside, having slashed his throat with a razor blade.  He was taken to the prison ward at General Hospital.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Greetings!  My name is Eddie Quette, and the powers that be here at the Bunker Hill blog have requested that I write about proper behavior.  Every week, hundreds of letters pour into the blog, asking about table manners, social refinement, polite human interactions, good taste,  and the like.  My job is to extract from this pile the most tasteful, insightful, and intelligent letters.  Then  I throw those away and attempt  to respond  to the rest.</p>
<p>So, without further ado, let&#8217;s dip into the ol&#8217; mailbag and read our first letter. This comes to us from a<br />
longtime resident of Highland Park.</p>
<p>Q.  Hello, I&#8217;m from Highland Park&#8230;.</p>
<p>A. We KNOW that, numbskull!  It was in the intro!</p>
<p>A. Oh, sorry.  Anyway, I&#8217;ve oft put off or bowed out of a ganking, as I struggle with what I imagine are common questions:  is a pearl-handled<br />
firearm gauche before dusk?  Are they &quot;not done&quot; after Labor Day? Is an automatic more appropriate when holding up dinner parties than a revolver?  Can I wear a blued nickel piece with brown shoes?  Please advise!</p>
<p>A.  I can see you are a man of taste and breeding.  Offhand, my answers to your questions  would be  yes, yes, no, and yes, unless they&#8217;re Oxford brogans, in which case a mauve nickel piece would look more dashing. Also, keep in mind that High Society seems to be entering a &quot;Green&quot; phase, in which environmental consciousness has seeped into every social clique, even the Gangster set. Thus, whereas only  last season the byword was that steel-jacketed tracer shells were &quot;de rigeur,&quot; now the most fashionable shootists are employing recycled graphite shells, as they use less energy and don&#8217;t pollute landfills. (I know, a bullet is such a SMALL thing, but just think, if we ALL switched over, think how much of our country&#8217;s precious natural resources we could save!)</p>
<p>Q.  I&#8217;ve  just dumped a limbless torso on Norton Avenue in the Crenshaw district, and I need a cab ride out of town PRONTO! My question is, how much should I tip the taxi driver?</p>
<p>A.  The standard answer is of course 15%, but there are some  additional factors in your case. Remember you will be asking this hapless fellow to ignore all speed limit signs on the way out of town, so that should add at least another 10%.  Plus, you will want to teach him to repeat the phrase &quot;I ain&#8217;t seen nothin&#8217;&quot;  at least 5000 times to bumbling LAPD detectives and reporter Jack Smith, so that&#8217;s worth another 5%.  Also, you didn&#8217;t mention whether the limbs from the body are dripping  liquid evidence on the cabbie&#8217;s  floor;  if so,  it would be both gallant and prudent to tip  him with a bottle of New Improved Borateen Blood &amp; Gore Remover.</p>
<p>Q. My name is Phineas J. Marsak.  Recently certain rogues and scalawags have been spreading tasteless rumors about my alleged activities with animals at the pet store on 3rd and Flower.  How can I convince my Whist and Billiards partners at the Jonathan and California Clubs that these innuendoes are utterly baseless, and originate from persons of low degree?  You know how those  sheep  lie!</p>
<p>A.  Mr. Marsak, I must urge  you in the strongest possible terms to refrain from reproducing your kind, whether with human females or ruminants. Were the Marsak line to continue, there is no telling what horrors would befall our planet!</p>
<p>Q.  I&#8217;ve been interested for quite a while in some of the more adventurous social encounters available in the Bunker Hill area, and recently I was invited to a rendezvous on a lane near Pershing Square called Vaseline Alley.  My query is, is it proper to  R.S.V.P. with a  hand-written note?  Or a  phone call?  Or via a liveried messenger boy, perhaps wearing short  tight spandex bicycle pants?  Also, my City Directory doesn&#8217;t list a Zip Code for Vaseline Alley.  Please advise.</p>
<p>A.  Well, they certainly have a &quot;Zipper code.&quot;  Namely, when you see the cops rounding the corner, zip up your zipper!</p>
<p>Well, that&#8217;s all the advice Eddie can dish out this time. Tune in regularly for further installments of his column, and should you find yourself in need of a little guidance as only Mr. Quette can provide, simply <a href="/feedback">email</a> your inquiry, or send it by carrier pigeon to On Bunker Hill, Clay Street, Old Los Angeles.</p>
