<p>The recent release of <a target="_blank" href="/georgemann">George Mannâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s 50-year-old color photographs</a> to this site is one of the most remarkable troves of <st1:place w:st="on">Bunker Hill</st1:place> ephemera weâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />ve seen in decades. The accompanying photo, for instance, shows just how dilapidated the neighborhood around Angels Flight on <st1:street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">Third Street</st1:address></st1:street> had become by November 1962, when Mann made his final pilgrimage to the doomed neighborhood. The wrecking ball has already claimed the Hill Crest Hotel at the top of the hill on <st1:street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">Olive Street</st1:address></st1:street>, and the <a target="_blank" href="/theAstoria">Astoria Hotel</a> is a hulking shell of a firetrap just waiting for a match. Standing near the center of the photo is the Sunshine Apartments, looking empty and haunted, but who knows whether a few derelict souls are still inside, refusing to leave until the bulldozers come growling down the hillside?</p>

Perched on a ten-feet-high retaining wall above a narrow alley called <st1:street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">Clay Street</st1:address></st1:street>, it sprawled halfway up a steep hill adjacent to a stairway, its only access, opposite Angels Flight. The Sunshine was the sort of multilevel dwelling that novelist John Fante described in <a target="_blank" href="/AsktheDust"><i>Ask the Dust</i></a> (1939): â€œIt was built on a hillside in reverse, there on the crest of Bunker Hill, built against the decline of the hill, so that the main floor was on the level with the street but the tenth floor was downstairs ten levels.â€ The only difference is that the Sunshine was only four stories tall and its front, not its sides, conformed to <st1:street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">Third Street</st1:address></st1:street>â€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s slant, so that the first floor was only half as wide as the second floor.

Midwestern migrants probably found the place comfortably familiar. Inside, a labyrinth of odd-angled hallways, step-downs and staircases connected the Sunshineâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s many small apartments.

Though it made its film debut as one of Angels Flightâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s neighbors in a 1920 comedy called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0245699/"><i>All Jazzed Up</i></a>, the Sunshine didnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t get its first close-up until 1932, when director James Whale cast it as the home of two downtown working girls (Mae Clark and Una Merkel) in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0023055/"><i>The Impatient Maiden</i></a>, his follow-up to <i>Frankenstein</i>. Because sound cameras in those days were large and unwieldy, he used a smaller silent camera to shoot the movieâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s opening scene on the <st1:street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">Third Street</st1:address></st1:street> steps, as the actresses came out of the Sunshine Apartments and walked up the concrete steps to the Angels Flight station on <st1:street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">Olive Street</st1:address></st1:street>. (The dialogue and traffic sounds were dubbed in later.) Whale shot another scene on the front steps near <st1:street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">Clay Street</st1:address></st1:street> and in the rear of the apartments, where a second set of concrete stairs from Clay to Olive ran between the Sunshine and the much larger Astoria Hotel.

But what turned the Sunshine Apartments into a fairly steady (if nameless) character actor was <i>film noir</i>, the mostly post-World War II crime genre that, in its focus on documentary realism, introduced the use of smaller, combat-tested cameras and gritty urban locations to Hollywood cinema. And sinceâ€”by the mid-1940sâ€”<st1:place w:st="on">Bunker Hill</st1:place> was a run-down neighborhood of crumbling Victorian mansions, rambling flophouses, and mean, vertiginous streets, it became the perfect setting for <i>film noir</i>â€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s fascination with the dark side of American prosperity. Despite the Sunshine Apartmentsâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> sunny moniker and relative youth (less than fifty years old), it did a great job portraying a shabby boarding house for desperate and worn-down people.

Robinson) hiding from his past. Director John Farrow pointedly established its location with an amazing 180-degree shotâ€”taken from Clay Streetâ€”that followed one of the Angels Flight cars up from Hill Street, and panned across the top of the hill to catch Robinsonâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s character hurrying down the concrete steps and up onto the third-floor porch and into the boarding houseâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s front door.

Granted, a couple of shots that showed either Burt Lancaster or Yvonne DeCarlo standing next to a bay window, with the Angels Flight trolleys moving in the background distance, were done on a sound stage. The footage of the incline railway cars passing each other above Clay Street was taken from the Sunshine (most likely from the third-floor porch, judging from the angle), but the building itself didnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t have any bay windows facing Angels Flight, so the scenes had to have been process shots. On the other hand, the maze of dingy hallwaysâ€”whose atmosphere one character mockingly dismissed as â€œPicturesque, ainâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t it?â€â€”most likely belonged to the Sunshine Apartments.

By the time the CRA carted away Angels Flight and the last two surviving houses on <st1:street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">Bunker Hill Avenue</st1:address></st1:street> four years later, the nearly century-old neighborhood of <st1:place w:st="on">Bunker Hill</st1:place> had ceased to exist.
