On the afternoon of August 21, 1924, residents of <st1:street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">328 Clay Street</st1:address></st1:street> were terror stricken by weird noises emanating from a room on the second floor of the building. There were scuffling sounds and urgent whisperings ”“ all of which sounded ominous enough to draw the attention of several residents in adjacent rooms. A few of the braver souls crept along the corridor until they were near enough to the room to hear voices.

A woman cried out “O, Henry! You wouldn”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t do that! Oh, no! No! No!

The deep guttural voice of a man snarled “You lied, you she-devil. You lied and lied, but if I swing into hell for it, you”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />ll never leave here to lie again.”

After deciphering the frantic messages, police concluded that each caller was reporting a murder at <st1:street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">328 Clay Street</st1:address></st1:street>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Location: 330 South Flower Street<br />
Date: September 21, 1937</p>
<p>Arrested on charges of stabbing J.T. Murray, 27-year-old laborer, as he stepped from a cafe at 234 East Fifth Street, was Charles Parsons, 19, of this address, captured with Victor Burk, 20, at Fifth and Spring Streets. Earlier, Murray had argued with two beggars who dunned him for a nickel, and a fistfight broke out. One of the beggars pulled a knife and stabbed Murray, who was taken to General Hospital with a belly wound that was expected to prove fatal. When frisked, Parsons&#8217; pockets revealed a bloody knife.</p>
