										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After the DWP and Dorothy Chandler went up, postcard photographers said <i>whoopee! something to shoot besides City Hall and the Chinese</i>.  So they cruised up to the bluff on <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=Huntley+Dr,+Los+Angeles,+Los+Angeles,+California+90026&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=35.684144,56.601563&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;cd=2&amp;geocode=FQCvBwIdbIrz-A&amp;split=0&amp;ll=34.058686,-118.257115&amp;spn=0.00912,0.013819&amp;t=h&amp;z=16" title="grassytrolls" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Huntley</a>, trained their lenses across Second and Beaudry toward First and Flower and fired away.  The day view is a Plastichrome by Colourpicture, the night view by Western Publishing &amp; Novelty, both circa 1965.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3309/3330403982_8f00fef17c_o.gif" alt="2ndBeaudryDay" height="366" width="575" /></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3301/3329570411_31ab7a226f_o.gif" alt="2ndBeaudryNite" height="362" width="575" /></p>
<p>Dig the Union station in all its <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsG9Ypr-jM0" title="76day" target="_blank" rel="noopener">76</a> ball <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSkUFY-6weM&amp;feature=related" title="76nite" target="_blank" rel="noopener">glory</a> (the SoCal station with its backlit chevron seems to be of an earlier vintage; they‘re both gone now).  Printers shops and giant spools line Beaudry.  Were it not for the necessity of capturing Becket and Martin‘s latest accomplishments, would we have any record of these?  Not likely.</p>
<p>Across the Pasadena Freeway, on Bunker Hill proper, on the west side of Figueroa between First and Second, that big white structure?  That‘s 123 South Figueroa, built in 1925.  Whatever the most photographed buildings on Bunker Hill were–the Castle, the Brousseau, the Dome?–if there‘s another image of <i>this</i> structure, I‘d love to see it.<br />
<img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3643/3332333090_9ae47f3779_o.gif" alt="Sanborn1955" height="376" width="575" /></p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3605/3334045309_1ef1db532c_o.gif" alt="theycallmethewanderer" align="right" height="185" width="250" /><br />
123 was erected as an office building, but in 1934 is turned into “one of the largest and most modern” government relief centers in the West.  The Federal Transient Service converted the building into its Southern California headquarters, i.e., a shelter for non-resident jobless men, outfitting it with an enormous cafeteria and dormitories that slept 500.  It became a veritable city in itself:  showers, lockers, hospital, educational and recreational facilities were installed, as were a laundry, shoe repair and tailor shop.  It was also a warehouse for materials and supplies used in the camps.  Yes, the camps.  Itinerant men had forty-eight hours to stay at Figueroa, max, before being assigned out of the city to transient work camps in forest and mountain areas.</p>
<p>Families, bands of “wild boys,” vagabonds on freight cars”¦in 1935 32,000 new transients came to California each month, 12,000 of those to Los Angeles.  July of 1935 alone saw a load of 20,000  paupers arrive in LA seeking State and Federal aid.  (And, one supposes, oranges that grew on palm trees.)  1,200 boys were sent to forestry camps, 4,000 men to the Federal aid camp near San Diego, but many of LA‘s transients–12% of the national and 60% of the State‘s burden–after being processed here at 123 South Fig, ended up in squatter‘s villages and squalid encampments.  Many went to homes and camps, were absorbed to into County Welfare healthily, found employ in the works relief programs or went back from whence they came, but either way, it does show and say something about the class shift of the Hill that such a major locus of poverty and despair should be located within its confines.</p>
<p>123 is converted to the police department‘s traffic division headquarters building in 1942.  The City Council gave the Police Commission $78,000 for the building and another $47,000 for the alterations.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3406/3334898604_3eea6796e7_o.gif" alt="deadication" height="158" width="400" />At the dedication, during a luncheon given on the third floor, attended by Mayor Bowron, Chief of Police Horral, and numerous high ranking police officers, Deputy Police Chief Caldwell announced that Los Angeles led the nation in the decrease in auto fatalities–which occurred through “strict, scientific enforcement of driving regulations.”  (Reports from 123 show that pedestrian fatalities in the first half of the 40s skyrocketed–dimouts for the war effort, don‘t ya know.)</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3360/3334879384_d7d19b0991_o.gif" alt="motorbike50" height="93" width="223" /><br />
The biggest piece of drama attached to the building came when in 1950 Parry Cottam, 27, a maintenance man at the police garage in the building, was moving a police motorcycle and it went out of control.  It plunged him through a large plate-glass window on the building‘s street level, and he was found unconscious on the sidewalk.  </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3632/3334045373_a4d118e4ba_o.gif" alt="theSale" align="right" height="123" width="242" /><br />
In March of 1964, the Board of Supervisors authorized sale of the county building to the CRA.  The CRA said they intended to develop the site into a motel.  The garage equipment goes up for auction in April 1971 and the 123 is presumably demolished failry soon thereafterward.  While the CRA didn‘t build a motel after clearing the site, the <a href="http://www.you-are-here.com/los_angeles/promenade.html" title="PTs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Promenade Towers</a>  have at least been described as a “<a href="http://www.apartmentratings.com/rate/CA-Los-Angeles-Promenade-Towers.html" title="thirtyonepercent" target="_blank" rel="noopener">roach motel</a>.”</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3359/3332332962_abe7c085c7_o.gif" alt="garagey" height="295" width="340" /></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3342/3332333226_ae93b035e3_o.gif" alt="everybodypromenade" height="334" width="456" /></p>
<p>It‘s a $60million dollar complex, the first mixed-use apartment complex in downtown Los Angeles and the area‘s first privately owned residential rental complex.  It has its formal opening June 16, 1986, the name <i>Promenade</i> intending to connote the era of pedestrian-oriented urbanism this project will usher in.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3540/3334045411_f2a1655c07_o.gif" alt="promPool" height="303" width="200" /></p>
<p>The Promenade becomes a favorite of Union Bank; they keep sixteen apartments there for visiting businessmen.  Tommy Lasorda himself keeps a pad in the Prom.  They‘re all drawn by the health club and gymnasium, market, pharmacy, dentist, cafÃ©/restaurant, the 24-hour reception and valet and garage attendants and so forth.  </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3583/3334045361_c179595ed4_o.gif" alt="promnow" height="276" width="575" /><br />
It remains to be seen whether the 123 regains its Reagan-era splendor, or if its residents, with their dry cleaner and little shop of sundries, doesn‘t harken back to its forgotten days as a haven for homeless men and law enforcement.</p>

<p>In what will surely go down as the smarmiest piece of journalism in history, the <i>Times</i> recounts the travails of Toy Lane, dancer at the Chinese Junk, 733 North Main. She <a title="thereabouts" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;source=s_d&amp;saddr=321+S+Olive+St,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90013&amp;daddr=733+N+Main+St,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90012&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;mra=ls&amp;sll=34.056588,-118.239412&amp;sspn=0.008266,0.013819&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=34.057886,-118.240378&amp;spn=0.008266,0.013819&amp;t=h&amp;z=16" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">made her way over</a> to the Junk from her pad at The Ems to shimmy for shekels on September 25, 1946. When she gets into the nightclub dressing room to “dress” for her act (the <i>Times</i>‘s flippant application of quotation marks, not mine) she discovers her wardrobe has been stolen: G-string No. 1 (black and orange, beaded,) $35; G-string No. 2 (silver metallic cloth,) $23; beaded shaker, $20; rhinestone brassiere $20; an anklet and armband set, $25.</p>
<p>Miss Lane, it was reported, was mortified–she had to dance with her clothes on!</p>
<p>In a final piece of facetiousness, the <i>Times</i> noted “the police were searching for the burglars and the large van they must have used to carry away the loot.”</p>
<p>The Chinese Junk CafÃ©:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3524/3285317465_7e0520d135_o.gif" alt="wheretogetjunk" width="575" height="373" /></p>
<p>Which was up in China City, a 1935 Chinesque development that predated New Chinatown, and had been the baby of wealthy socialite and “Mother of Olvera Street” Christine Sterling. China City was mostly burned out, literally and figuratively, by the early 50s.</p>
<p>And of Ms. Toy‘s home, the Ems?</p>
<p>Remember the <a title="KPCA" href="/KelloggPalaceCasaAlta" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Palace/Casa Alta</a> post, which was long on storytelling but short on pretty pictures? I even chided you for looking at a structure that was <i>not</i> our hotel-in-question, by tossing Ã¼ber-comely Bunker Hill lass The Ems smack dab into the mix.<br />
<img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3503/3293618232_7498ba5fd8_o.gif" alt="avertyoureyes" width="456" height="232" /></p>
<p>I even promised I‘d talk about the Ems “next week,” but by <a title="sor" href="/SonsoftheRevolution" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">next week</a> it was President‘s Day, and <i>somebody</i> had to make you mindful of your nation, despite all the patriotic work you were doing watching <a title="gobama" href="http://consumerist.com/5153770/obama-collectors-coins-turn-out-to-be-stickers-stuck-on-regular-coins" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Obama informercials</a>.</p>
<p>Well, now it‘s the week after next, and it‘s time for the Ems, which is replete with pretty pictures but sadly short on storytelling. Here‘s what we know.</p>
<p>Charles Clayton <span class="highlight">Emswiler</span> came to LA in the boom eighties and went into the apartment-house building game. In August of 1905 he pulled permits to build his eponymous Mission-style Ems, designed by none other than Joesph Cather Newsom.  Emswiler died in 1922, age 69, in the apartment house at 321 that bore his name.</p>
<p>It contains 110 rooms, divided into twenty-six apartments according to the 1939 census, sixty-five apartments according to the 1950 Sanborn map.  Here it is before its birth, from the 1896 Sanborn map (321, bottom), and postnatal from the 1906:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3384/3298297798_8d9f28d0ed_o.gif" alt="sanborn1896" width="455" height="309" /></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3297/3297470819_ca1fc8e8ef_o.gif" alt="sanborn06" width="455" height="225" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3083/3285716032_7bba1c3874_o.gif" alt="emsca1906" width="568" height="400" /></p>
<p>Our earliest known shot, above. Pre-1908, because the Kellogg has yet to be built to the north. Notice the three round-arch traceried windows along the street, and the turreted house to the south.</p>
<p>We know that it had a large ballroom, for in 1909 the papers announced that sixty couples participated in the dancing at the inaugural ball honoring President Taft.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3236/3284896999_d78168ba7f_o.gif" alt="ems1910" width="423" height="400" /></p>
<p>The Ems were apartments-of-choice for a collection of colorful characters.</p>
<p><b>1914.</b> “Mohawk Half-Breed” Daniel T. La Rae, alias Daniel T. Ray, was an Ems resident (Emsident?) with Miss Emma Ewalt–they stayed there together, but were (!) unmarried. Daniel spent a lot of time promising to marry Miss Ewalt, even going so far as to travel to Shelby, Ohio, to visit her father. Mostly what Daniel did, though, is borrow money–he needed these sums to purchase marble on bond to build post offices and such. Of course he could be trusted; he <i>was</i> a Federal Officer, after all.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3620/3293617828_ce41427bcc_o.gif" alt="drevil" width="139" height="300" align="left" /><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3228/3292794367_70311fb13d_o.gif" alt="suitor4revenue" width="295" height="300" align="right" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He had shown Emma a badge emblazoned “U. S. Marshal,” but never paid back the money nor made good on his promise of marriage. Of course his badge was a phony as his promises. Turns out his real job was for the Southern Pacific RR, guarding Chinese as they were ferried from San Francisco across the Mexican border line. Chinese actually go home to Mexico. Little known fact.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3306/3292794435_a4db89c461_o.gif" alt="likkerseezed" width="252" height="138" align="right" /><b>1924.</b> Emsians Jack Hart and James Whitmore were no mere bathtub gin fanciers, nor busted-at-the-speak spuds; the Feds seized Hart &amp; Whitmore‘s forty cases of champagne, seventy-five cases of Scotch, and seventy-three cases of gin, crÃ¨me de menthe and grain alcohol down at their warehouse, <a title="1840wetookalittletrip" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=1840+Lebanon+St,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90015&amp;sll=34.034988,-118.270818&amp;sspn=0.000511,0.001727&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=34.036089,-118.270826&amp;spn=0.009122,0.013819&amp;t=h&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1840 Lebanon</a>. The liquor was valued at $40,000. In addition to the liquor, the drys seized a large truck, three touring cars and several rifles.</p>

<p>Above, the Ems in 1912 and a William Reagh image ca. 1960.  Notice the rounded tripartite fenestration, which worked so well with the rest of the faÃ§ade, has been changed to a single remaining arched window, a square window, and a doorway.  This is due to owner William Fisher&#8217;s February 1927 alteration–he hires architect B. N. Rickard, of whom you have never heard, and rightfully so, since this is pretty clunky work, to convert the lobby into two bedrooms and turn the ball room into a new lobby.  (Note too that the neighboring house–built in 1887-88 by Howard W. Mills, of real estate firm Mills, Crawford, Pauly &amp; Clapp–at 327 South Olive has been reduced to a concrete pit, demolished for a parking lot in the summer of 1948. )</p>

As soon as she got the job, she was attacked by mother‘s son James D. Anderson. Erma wasn‘t the first to have met with the fate of an Anderson Employee–one Marguerite Cooper, 23, also testified with Erma in Municipal Court about a similar sitch, and the Judge ordered Anderson held on $10,000 bail.</p>

Hey, I warned you that the Ems lacked gripping and protracted tales. But look at those pretty pictures.</p>

And despite Harold‘s line to his Uncle Victor–“during wartime the national suicide rate goes down”–on Bunker Hill, there‘s still wartime Selbsmord (the <a title="wherewereyouin42" href="/HotelBelmont" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belmont</a> had two in ‘42). It‘s easy to posit that the suicide rate is a constant, and the papers make a point of reporting ”˜em during wartime to detract the populace from all those incoming body bags. If you go for that sort of mass-media-control conspiracy. That notwithstanding, nine months after we got into the war, Joseph Buotha, a 58-year-old former private investigator, ate several bottles of pills in his Ems apartment. He had just written a long telegram to Eleanor Roosevelt, and this note: “Please let me alone. Let fate take its course. Notify John G. Wenk to take care of my belongings. Please don‘t hurt the dog. May God forgive you.”</p>

Joe Rupino, 50, was leaning over the railing on the second story balcony, shaking the dust from a rug, when the railing gave way and he fell fifteen feet to the pavement. Rupino received possible fractures of the right wrist, forearm and shoulder, and a trip to Georgia Street and a transfer to General Hospital.</p>
<p>There‘s that railing! The railing of DEATH!</p>

<p>Ok, the railing of death. It‘s not much, but it‘s something.</p>
<p>Of course we know how the story ends.  The Ems gets its demo permit pulled in July 1965.  By the summer of &#8217;66 it&#8217;s just a pile where a truck can pull up, while erstwhile neighbor the Casa Alta is undergoing a similar fate:</p>

<p>After the last few posts–piles of brick, crenellated castles, Neo-Classical noodling–I am happy to say <i>look at all that stucco</i> (stucco that‘s <u>supposed</u> to be there, not stucco that was thrown over shingle–although to be honest, it wasn‘t thrown over adobe brick, either). The deep arcades, the rounded arches, the low-pitched red tile roofs”¦Mission Revival sure oozes picturesque. Were the square flat roof to call a California antecedent to mind, you might think of the 1894 <a title="burlingametrainstation" href="http://www.pbase.com/jacklouis/image/79762288" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Burlingame train station</a>. <img loading="lazy" title="" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3336/3297357159_ed8695149e_m.jpg" alt="flatroof" width="240" height="149" />The Ems is “twin tower”, Ã¡ la the Santa Barbara Mission, and of course there‘s the contemporary tri-tower version a couple blocks over, the somewhat less Mission and more Moorish <a title="SR" href="/StRegis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">St. Regis.</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it comes to architecture important to this part of the world, it can be argued that Spanish Colonial/Mission Revival is our own honest, expressive flowering, that‘s crowd-pleasing but not childish, sometimes silly but never stupid, hard to notice sometimes and often hard to preserve.</p>
<p>It‘s sad to lose Bunker Hill in general; we&#8217;re sorry to lose the Ems in particular.</p>
