</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--><!--[endif]-->The Sentous Block is best known around noirsville as where Mike Hammer cruises over to the Jalisco Hotel in <i>Kiss Me Deadly</i>; it also contained the Bamba Club, which doubles as the Round-Up in <i>Criss Cross</i>.<span>Â  </span>(Both on the Spring St. side of the Sentous; our image shows the Main St. side.)<span>Â  </span>For more than you would ever want to know about this, go <a href="https://forum.skyscraperpage.com/showthread.php?p=4852728" title="noirsville" target="_blank">here</a> <span></span>(seems like contributor Beaudry needs a girlfriend or something).

<p class="MsoNormal">
But on to Bunker Hill!
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
Ah, the Astoria.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<a href="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4065/4676076215_b9121b04fe.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4065/4676076215_b9121b04fe.jpg" alt="Astorian" height="500" width="442" /></a>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
Nothing says deep arcaded entry and red-tiled bell tower like â€œAstoriaâ€.<span>Â  </span>Yes, one can not help but marvel at the incongruity of Bunker Hill naming systems.<span>Â  </span>I wrote earlier in OBH about the red-tiled onion domed <i>Minnewaska</i>, the fairly Franco-Renaissance <i>Sherwood</i>, and while it hasnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t been explored yet, the decisively Mission-styled 1904 Mission Apartments at Second and Olive spent much of its young life known as, of course, Castle Craig.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--><!--[endif]-->Astoria, the Greek word for quail, is also the part of Queens known for being full of Greeks.Â  <span></span>That notwithstanding, at the time of its construction, <i>Astoria</i><span style="font-style: normal"> connoted the Astoria, Queens that was then the â€œHollywood of the East.â€<span>Â  </span>Plus it had been named for John Jacob Astor.<span>Â  </span>All sorts of cachet.<span>Â  </span>Perhaps the developers thought that despite the arches and fauxdobe, the rather otherwise traditional use of the bay windows prevented naming the structure something vaguely Missiony like â€œRamona Hotelâ€ or â€œPortolÃ  Apts.</span><span style="font-style: normal">â€ </span>
</p>
<p>In any event, of the Astoria much <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/theAstoria" title="lifeanddeath" target="_blank">has been said</a>.Â <br />
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--><!--[endif]-->Next to the Astoria is the 1916 Blackstone Apartments, with the nice Beaux Arts garlands uponâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t.<span>Â  </span>Not a whole lot happened there, an ex-cop caught violating the Wright Act,<span> </span>and there were some lady bootleggers; while the Widows Protective League Los Angeles Branch Council met at the Blackstone, a widow took poison and offed herself there the very same year (1929); and Ross Page, younger brother of the widely-known <a href="https://www.insroland.org/farmerpage" title="FahmaPage" target="_blank">â€œFarmerâ€ Page</a>, was busted there by the vice squad while running two bridge games and a poker game in August of â€˜25.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
I will let Matt Weinstock of the <i>Times</i><span style="font-style: normal"> do the talking for me:</span>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">
<!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--><!--[endif]--><i>That din emanating from Bunker Hill these days is the relentless pounding of the jackhammers tearing down the ancient Blackstone Apartments, 244 S Olive St., next door to the top of Angelâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Flight.</i>
</p>
<div align="justify">
</div>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">
<i>Until the demolition crew went to work on it, the Blackstone was nine stories high, counting the floors from the back entrance in the alley, which was kept locked.<span>Â  </span>However, if you entered on Olive St., as most people did, you were on the third floor, and from there it was only a six story building.<span>Â  </span>I learned this many years ago in visiting a departed colleague, <a href="https://latimesblogs.latimes.com/thedailymirror/2010/04/matt-weinstock-april-25-1960.html" title="JFBA" target="_blank">J. Farrington Barrington Arrington</a>, who lived there.</i>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">
<i>And so another quaint landmark passes and now, when I go into a building on what purports to be the main floor it will really be the main floor, not the third.<span>Â  </span>Progress marches on.<br />

<hr width="100%" size="2" />
<p>Bunker Hill is a lost Los Angeles neighborhood, and On Bunker Hill is a memorial website that was born over the course of a year&#8217;s collaboration. The contributors followed their own particular obsessions down the historical rabbit hole, coming up with aspects of the community&#8217;s lore that were placed on a virtual map, so interested visitors could explore at their leisure. </p>
<p>Although On Bunker Hill is no longer being updated, people continue to discover the site and contribute their own insights and memories through the comment section. But occasionally, someone comes along who has something more to offer than a comment or a link, and so we bring the On Bunker Hill blog back to life for a brief moment, so this someone can take their rightful place among the ghosts.</p>
<p>Enter George Mann. <br />
<img src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4068/4653170886_499f7db049_m.jpg" /></p>
<p>Born in Santa Monica in 1905, by his early 20s he was a vaudeville star as the hilariously taller half of the comedy dance team <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barto_and_Mann" target="_blank">Barto &amp; Mann</a>. Dewey Barto [real name Dewey Smoyer and the pop of comedienne <a href="https://blog.wfmu.org/freeform/2007/12/365-days-338--.html" target="_blank">Nancy Walker</a>] and George debuted their act on the west coast circuit in 1926 and by March 1927 were featured on the other Broadway, at New York&#8217;s celebrated Palace Theatre. </p>
<p>Of their east coast debut, <a href="https://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,740063,00.html" target="_blank"><i>Zit&#8217;s Theatrical Newspaper</i></a> raved &quot;Ten minutes before they went on at the Palace last Monday afternoon nobody thought very much about Barto &amp; Mann; ten minutes after they came off stage, the whole Broadway world was talking about them&#8230; Acts like these only come along once in a while.&quot; <br />

<p>Appearing at L.A.&#8217;s Orpheum in March 1928, they were praised in the <i>L.A. Times</i> as &quot;a knockout team,&quot; though their set at the Hillstreet the following month discomfited one reviewer: &quot;The act presented by Barto &amp; Mann was one of those hectic affairs in which the participants did everything from a climb up the proscenium arch to a near-back-flip into the orchestra pit. The excellence of the dancing and clowning in the early portions of the act led one to expect a much more worthwhile finale than the one offered, which, unfortunately, bordered plainly on vulgarity.&quot;Â </p>
<p>One man&#8217;s vulgarity is another&#8217;s hilarity: scope out this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWVojP9GDCc#t=03m39s" target="_blank">rare filmed appearance</a>, from the 1933 Texas Guinan vehicle &quot;Broadway Through A Keyhole,&quot; and decide for yourself!</p>
<p>As Vaudeville faded, Barto &amp; Mann joined the Broadway cast of Olson and Johnson&#8217;s <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/brad_smith/4508325712/" target="_blank"><i>Hellzapoppin&#8217;</i></a> (though they&#8217;re not in the 1941 film), with featured billing from 1938 through 1942. The team split up in December 1943.</p>
<p>Around this time, George Mann married <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Robert_Powers" target="_blank">Powers Agency</a> model Barbara Bradford and shot a series of film noir-inspired images of his young bride. Â </p>

<p>In his post-performance life, George Mann turned his imagination to entrepreneurial enterprise and professional photography, which brought him to Bunker Hill. In the late 1950s, when the neighborhood&#8217;s days were known to be numbered, he arrived atop the peak with his camera to document some representative scenes, returning in November 1962 for additional shots. </p>

<p>These never-before-published color images of old Bunker Hill were originally displayed in 3-D viewers of Mann&#8217;s own design, which were leased to various Los Angeles businesses, including Hody&#8217;s Drive-Ins, and other restaurants, bars and doctor&#8217;s offices. Mann would swap out the photo selection regularly, so if these evocative scenes of Bunker Hill weren&#8217;t available, one might peep at Calico Ghost Town, Catalina Island, Descanso Gardens, Disneyland, Knott&#8217;s Berry Farm, Pacific Ocean Park, Watts Towers or Palm Springs.Â Â </p>
<p>In his 3-Dimensional Bunker Hill set, created to distract anxious patients and hungry tourists, George Mann captured a seldom seen side of this lost Los Angeles neighborhood: the gracious avenues and genteel decay, the old people, their cats and their gardens, abandoned newspapers, vacant lots, the shadows and the sunlight. We are in his debt.</p>
<p>George Mann died in 1977, and his extraordinary photographic archives are currently being organized, scanned and made available for licensing. We trust you will enjoy these rediscovered images from old Bunker Hill from the George Mann Archives.</p>
