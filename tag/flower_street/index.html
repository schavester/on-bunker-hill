Thomas Major Jr., 34, a logger by profession, down from Vancouver to take in the town.  He was in the barroom at the Rollin Hotel, Third and Flower, when the cops came in to investigate a brawl, January 24, 1960.  They have a funny way of doing things up in British Columbia, apparently, for as the bulls were bracing some other bar patron, Major pulled out a gun, pointed it at the cops’ backs, and began pulling the trigger.  The cops heard the click-click of two empty chambers, turned, and fired seven shots at Major.</p>
<p>Major was hit seven times, taking four in the abdomen.  Detectives Pailing and Buckland, with Municipal Judge Griffith in tow, made a visit to Major’s bed in the prison ward at General Hospital, where they charged him with two counts of assault with intent to commit murder and one of violating the deadly weapons control law.</p>
<p>The GH docs had pulled all sorts of lead from Major, but there was still the matter of the bullet in Major’s <i>heart</i>.  Yes, normally a slug from a Parker-issued K-38 in the ticker is going to put you down for good.  But this one found its place there in an unsual way; one of those bullets to the abdomen apparently passed through the liver, entered a large vein and was pumped into the upper right chamber of the heart, passed through the valve to the lower left chamber, an in that ventricle there it sat.  Apparently you can’t just leave well enough alone, so someone had to go in and get the damn thing.</p>
<p>Enter Drs. <a href="https://ats.ctsnetjournals.org/cgi/content/full/66/6/2132" title="lymanplace" target="_blank">Lyman Brewer</a> and Ellsworth Wareham, of the <a href="https://www.whitememorial.com/about/history/index.php" title="CME" target="_blank">College of Medical Evangelists</a>.  They’d removed plenty of bullets from hearts using the old “closed-heart method,”&#157; but here thought they’d try something new—having a heart-lung machine on hand, they thought they’d throw that into the mix.  No more working without seeing what you’re doing:  with the heart-lung machine, the heart could be drained of blood, and the surgeon can see and feel what’s transpiring.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.llu.edu/news/today/mar0404/mc.html#1" title="DrJoan" target="_blank">Dr. Joan Coggin</a>, who assisted, also noted that they’ve established a new approach to heart surgery in that they incised the heart on the underside, and not in the front; the electrical pattern of the heart, as evidenced by their electrocardiogram, has shown that this method results in far less serious consequence to the heart during surgery.  </p>

All this medical breakthrough, and all because some liquored Canuck on Bunker Hill decided to blast away at the heat!

<p>A bit on the Hotel Rollin, as long as we’re here.  Its building permits are issued July 9, 1904.  Its two and three room suites are each furnished with bath and kitchen.</p>

		<p>May 6, 1915.  Mr. H. J. Robinson, of 210 South Flower, met long-time acquaintance Ernest Lightfoot at another house Robinson owned at 121 South Flower.  While the two were inspecting 121—Lightfoot had proposed Robinson trade him the house for some land in the Imperial Valley—Lightfoot slugged the elderly Robinson, knocking him unconscious.  </p>
<p>Robinson recovered consciousness enough to feel someone tugging at his diamond ring—which he’d never been able to get off himself, though Lightfoot was able to do enough of a number on Robinson’s finger to effect removal.</p>
<p>While Robinson recovered in Westlake Hospital, suffering contusions of the head and a concussion of the brain (and a bruised finger), Lightfoot was picked up by detectives.  Turns out this Lightfoot was the same charmer who in 1910 was charged with rape and given five years probation, and who in 1914 was arrested for child abandonment.</p>

For the article they dug up one of the original uprooted persons, a Jim Dorr, 73, who’d been sent a notice by the CRA to vacate the Stanley Apartments on November 15, 1965.  He’s glad he saved those displacement papers all these years:  HUD will give him priority in the otherwise random lottery.</p>
<p>Sez Jim:</p>
<p>“I’ve been around Bunker Hill off and on now for forty or fifty years.  They say it was nice once.  But they let it run down for years.  The Stanley was a very old place, well kept, but they didn’t spend much money on it.”&#157;</p>
<p>(Just for the record, despite what it says in the caption at right, the Bunker Hill Towers are not on the spot of the Stanley.  The Stanley is at the red hatched box below; Dorr&#8217;s standing at the blue dot.)</p>

<p>Looking down 2nd toward Hope.  (Needless to say, Bunker Hill Avenue has removed itself from the equation.)Â  (But then, so has pretty much everything else.)</p>

		<p>A glance at mid-century America reveals it emblazoned with the familiar totems:  military might, industrial supremacy, cultural imperialism.  These were carved by fervent if not blind <i>progress</i>, and you’d be given a funny look (if not worse) were you to dare question <i>that</i>.  </p>
<p>Nobody would dare bat an eye as freeways forever cut up cities, and huge swaths of our collective memory were lost to parking lots and well-intentioned developments.  Funny old buildings were the realm of <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/MunstersofBunkerHill" title="universalmutants" target="_blank">mutants</a>, after all.</p>
<p>But even in the glory days of unquestioned, unfettered forward movement—before, say, Dallas ’63 and Watts ’65—there was a small rumbling of (not unpatriotic) discontent.  Landmarks were lost hand over fist but when in 1962 it came time for <a href="https://www.nyc-architecture.com/GON/GON004.htm" title="6-5000" target="_blank">Penn Station</a> to become so much New Jersey Medowlands landfill, eyebrows were raised.  This was <i>Penn Station</i>, after all.  Somebody at <i>Life</i> magazine (somebody who ambled through Penn Station to the <i>Life</i> offices at Rockefeller Center, most likely) realized that losing our common heritage would make a nifty nine-page spread.  And so <i>Life</i> called upon heavyweight photojournalist <a href="https://www.getty.edu/art/gettyguide/artMakerDetails?maker=1634" title="WEsnapper" target="_blank">Walker Evans</a> to do the immortalizing.</p>
<p>Walker shot in New York, as well as Norwalk, Conn; Boston and Amesbury, Mass; then out to California for Nevada City, San Francisco, and, in October of 1962, Los Angeles.  Where he made a beeline to Bunker Hill.  He shot all over the Hill but curiously took his greatest number of shots of 101 South Flower, and it was 101 South Flower that made it into the magazine:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3229/3087581193_894f6b9af5_o.gif" alt="FirstFlowerLife" height="553" width="250"></p>
<p>What can be said of 101-109, aka 101-111 South Flower?  Precious little.  We know that it is announced in February of 1904, to run $16,000 ($364,809 USD 2007).</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3164/3087579775_8a94a883db_o.gif" alt="comingout" height="70" width="463"></p>
<p>But a thorough check of its various addresses shows that nothing of consequence ever there occurred.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3242/3087579743_4390916b8e_o.gif" alt="towardfront" height="476" width="493"></p>
<p>The southwest corner of First and Flower:</p>

Marie heard Clifford was dead, and so she remarried, only Clifford wasn’t dead, just…disappeared.  To Bunker Hill.  She lived down on 37th Street; Bunker Hill may as well be the moon.  After six years of Clifford being “deceased”&#157; she caught wind that he wasn’t, had him tracked down, and he was popped at our First &amp; Flower apartment house in November 1925 on a deadbeat dad charge.  That’s about as racy as it gets; that, and the residents of this particular place had a terrible habit of stepping off of this curb and that into fatally well-built oncoming automobiles.</p>

<p>Fortunately what we lack in drama we make up for in image quantity.  It was captured of course by the incomparable Arnold Hylen:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3233/3088417734_a49510c6d0_o.gif" alt="hylen101SF" height="373" width="575"></p>
<p>Today, of course, the building is demolished, but one isn’t always expecting to find the same thing to have happened to the <i>street</i>.  Where has all the Flower gone?</p>
<p>In each of the two images below:  First at the top, Second at the bottom, Figueroa at the left (yes, I know Fig is a Street and not an Avenue, that’s Baists for you) Hope on the right.  In the top image, Flower runs down the middle, and there’s 101 in orange, with “Labarere Tr.”&#157; (for Labarere Tract) written across it.  In the modern image below, well Flower just went away.</p>

This action is largely credited for impregnating America with preservation consciousness.  This <a href="https://www.preservationnation.org/magazine/2008/books/" title="noharmnofoul" target="_blank">isn’t true</a>, of course, but that’s ok.</p>
<p>In writing about the Amesbury, Mass. <a href="https://www.historicnewengland.org/visit/homes/rocky.htm" title="RHMH" target="_blank">Rocky Hill Meeting House</a> <i>Life</i> notes that a proposed expressway is taking down three 18th-century buildings and coming within yards of the structure, which is in a state of <a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/collection_database/objectview_altviewenlarge.aspx?page=51&amp;sort=3&amp;sortdir=asc&amp;keyword=&amp;fp=51&amp;dd1=0&amp;dd2=0&amp;vw=1&amp;collID=0&amp;OID=190037903&amp;vT=1&amp;iID=15&amp;iPage=2" title="holyholy" target="_blank">miraculous state</a> of preservation.  This writer does not know if the 1963 worries about blasting and vibrations undermined the building, or played havoc with the 1780s glazing, but I do know that the 495 is now a stone’s throw away, and I call that wrong.  </p>

After a three-year battle, citizens saved the mansion by referendum; the city ignored this and set out to build the city hall on the mansion grounds <i>again</i>.

<p>And so while the vast majority of the subjects in <i>Life</i>’s article survived to see another millennium, 101 South Flower did not.  Nor did any of the any other structures shot by Evans that Los Angeles October.</p>

Mrs. Emma Rupe was fixated on <i>being</i> a mother.  So much so that on July 5, 1936, the Denver waitress took a fancy to John, the two year-old son of Mr. and Mrs. John Richard O’Brien.  John, it seems, looked just like Emma’s own toddler who’d died nine years previous.  On the pretext that she was going to take the little darling out to buy him a playsuit (the O’Briens being trusting souls, and near penniless, so how could they refuse?) Emma thereupon took John shopping…as far from Denver as she could get, and with as great a chance of disappearing as possible.  Because clichés are born of truth, noir clichés especially, she beelined straight for Los Angeles, Bunker Hill specifically, and checked into the St. Regis.</p>
<p>

<p>
For ten weeks the FBI combed the States until they were tipped off by an acquaintance of Emma’s, and on September 19 the Feds descended on 237 South Flower.  Emma, 30, was pulled from the St. Regis hysterical and weeping; the boy, whom she called “Jackie,”&#157; appeared impassive.  Emma Rupe broke down again when a Denver jury gave her twenty to life.</p>

Much in the way a French Renaissance building might be dubbed the Sherwood, this Missionesque structure is named after a French nobleman—<a href="https://content.stregis.org/parish/templates/info.aspx?articleid=892&amp;zoneid=73" title="theReg" target="_blank">J. F. Regis</a>, tireless converter of Huguenots, and advocate of lacemaking for wayward girls.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The St. Regis leads a fairly quiet life.  Other than the aforementioned FBI intrusion in 1936, there was the small matter of the coppers showing up to collect Elmer Hudson, 32, and his wife Betty, 20, in 1928.  When two bad guys held up a café at <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=200+N+Dillon+St,+Los+Angeles,+Los+Angeles,+California+90057,+United+States&amp;sll=34.075039,-118.283315&amp;sspn=0.008727,0.013819&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;cd=1&amp;layer=c&amp;ll=34.078096,-118.281426&amp;spn=0.008726,0.013819&amp;z=16&amp;cbll=34.07374,-118.28216&amp;panoid=S1CP8ye7XYSpRibTsQ-_iQ" title="wink" target="_blank">200 Dillon Street</a> and made off with $300 ($3,554 USD2007), Betty made the mistake of not keeping her bad-guy self in the shadows.  Café owner C. V. Anderson recognized her as a former waitress.</p>
<p>What is it about these wayward gals—waitresses both—that can’t keep their clutchy paws off money nor baby?  Maybe they’ll learn some lacemaking in the pen.  Make St. Regis proud.</p>

The Bozwell Apartments (which seem to shoot for Greek Revival but, oddly, come off as Monterrey) next door at 245, abandoned, burn on May 22, 1962.</p>

<p>The blaze, reported the Times, was believed to have been “touched off by hobos.”&#157;</p>
<p>While firemen kept the conflagration from spreading to the St. Regis, its days were just as numbered as if it were the Bozwell itself.</p>
<p>For these were heady days:  the Lesser Festivals of Abandoment, The Princial Feasts of Official Neglect, and the Commemorations of Escalating Mysterious Fires.  Obligatory for the observant.</p>

		<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2254/2660612112_3f255d818e_o.gif" alt="Marcella" height="592" width="575">Today we discuss The Marcella, who once flaunted her classical order on Flower (she is Italian, please be advised the C in her name is not pronounced <i>s</i> as in <i>sell</i>, but like <i>ch</i> as in <i>chin</i>).  See how her name beckons, proud but not haughty, from her entablature?  She wants to take you in and protect you under that great cornice with her large corbels.  Despite her imposing presence, she is warm, and welcoming; the wide porches bespeak grace, and the timberframe vernacular on the bays coo <i>cozy by the fire lad, there’s good feelings in mortise and tenon</i>.  </p>
<p>But don’t speak of  fire.  Fire struck the Marcella in October of 1912, sending well-to-do ladies like Mrs. L. M. Harvey to Pacific Hospital after having leapt from upper stories.  Other occupants hustled (stricken with panic; see below) and scantily attired into the street.  Marcella owner C. F. Holland states he’s looking at $3,000 ($65,983 USD2007) in damages, $2,000 to the rugs and furniture alone.  <br>
<img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3236/2660611730_dcbcdcb8cb_o.gif" alt="PanicStricken" height="141" width="526"><br>
It is reported that a man was seen running from the building a few minutes before the fire broke out.  The storeroom, where the fire began, was not locked.  The mystery is never solved but Marcella, stout of bay and stalwart of column, cannot be burned away.  She perseveres.<br>
<img loading="lazy" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2001/2660612342_da8059f7d9_o.gif" alt="Cometomother" height="820" width="575"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Marcella is a building so lovely she attracts only the comeliest of patrons.  She is home to Miss May Long, a lass so fetching that when in May of 1913 she turned her attentions to one Earl G. Horton, he is gunned down by another suitor outside of his apartment house near <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=1129+W+Temple+St,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90012&amp;sll=34.068214,-118.251193&amp;sspn=0.00855,0.013304&amp;layer=c&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=34.067841,-118.251235&amp;spn=0.00855,0.013304&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr&amp;cbll=34.063953,-118.25192&amp;panoid=GHaKiWGCNCAnGNrIWbCV1Q" title="shooting" target="_blank">Temple &amp; Victor</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jealousy over a woman causes upset <i>again</i> at the Marcella on October 25 of 1922 when Emergency Patrolman Claude Coffrin went to visit Mrs. Tillie Smith in her Marcella apartment.  Not long after Coffrin&#8217;s ingress, there appeared Emergency Patrolman Anthony Kazokas and a civilian, Joe Cummins.  Kazokas had loaned Cummins his revolver and badge to settle his romantic score with Coffrin over Tillie.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3222/2661876479_09a095e2ae_o.gif" alt="nothingbuttroubleItellya" height="117" width="488"></p>
<p>Coffrin and Cummins fought, and Coffrin gained control of the gun; he phoned the Detective Bureau and over came officers Nickens and Ellis.  Cummins at that point grabbed the gun back from Coffrin and stuck it in Nickens’ side, and Patrolman Kazokas jumped on Detective Ellis.  Ellis brained Kazokas out cold with the butt of his gun, but Nickens ended up shooting Cummins through the neck.  </p>
<p>The lovely Mrs. Smith was arrested on violation of parole; she had been sentenced on the 18th to pay $50 and spend thirty days in jail—suspended—for “social vagrancy”&#157;.  Apparently, quality of young lady was beginning to decline at the Marcella.<br>

Other upstanding members of society to grace the Marcella’s rooms were the Jacksons, of whom you read all about <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/node/118" title="NISA" target="_blank">here</a>. <br>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And remember <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/iwantolive" title="idont" target="_blank">Barbara Graham</a>?  What helped send Barbara to the chair was hubby Henry’s testimony on the witness stand.  Her last-ditch alibi was that she and Henry were together that night of March 9, 1953—but Henry testified he had already moved out and was living with his mother…at the Marcella.  (A mere two blocks down from the Lancaster, scene of Baxter Shorter&#8217;s abduction.)</p>
<p>Little Tommy Graham, now five, was living in the Marcella in 1957 when Wanger Pictures gave him $1000 for filming his executed mother’s life story.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fire again struck the Marcella, this time in 1962, and this time it meant business.  On March 30 a blaze razed the upper two stories of the structure.  Twelve fire units quelled the blaze in half an hour; She of 223 South Flower vanished from memory soon afterward.</p>
<p>Here we are looking north on Flower through the intersection of Third, 1965.  See the little Victorian, left center?  The Marcella was just on the other side of that.<br>
<img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3091/2660612482_6fe71a9943_o.gif" alt="UpFlower" height="410" width="575"><br>
Today Flower Street makes a sharp turn between Third and Second to avoid the Bunker Hill Towers.  The Marcella stood just on the other side of this pool:</p>

<p>Interesting, and, what, perhaps a little unnerving, but certainly instructive, to consider that the image that began this post, and the one immediately above, were taken from the same spot.</p>
