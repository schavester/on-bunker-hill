The Corinthian columns!  Those dentils!  Donâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t they just scream <i>Dope Addict Goes Berserk</i>?</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3183/2600688325_57be534115_o.jpg" alt="hottrannymess" align="right" height="108" width="239" /><b>December 28, 1918.</b>  Juvenille officers were called to a vacant lot at First and Hope where young toughs were blasting away at tin cans with their air rifles.  The two collared ringleaders were on their way to the station house when one of the youngsters tucked a lock of long hair under his capâ€¦he being Miss Juanita Stuart, fourteen, of the Rossmere.  She protested tearfully when her mother was instructed by officers to burn the costume of khaki trousers, flannel shirt and boyâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s sweater, and to keep the young lady attired in feminine apparel only thereafter.</p>
<p><b>July 1, 1927.</b>  William Barrett, Rossmerian, had been arrested at the hotel by officers on Volstead violations and entered into evidence was one large bottle of gin.  At Barrettâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s trial the prosecuting attorney sought to clinch a conviction by producing said bottle, but, like a reversed wedding at Cana, a police property room at LAPD will turn gin into water.  </p>

<p>Barrett went back to the Rossmere a free man, thankful to the police for working a miracle.</p>

Bitters, 82, a former shoplifter by trade, decided on September 5 of this year to stop eating.  The fourteen-year resident of the Rossmere simply found life â€œno longer worth living,â€ which is reasonable enough (moreover recently-assassinated Gandhi had made fasting fashionable).  But Bitters was descended upon by members of the Community Chest and the Salvation Armyâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Golden Agers Club, who bundled him up and trundled him off to General Hosptial for psychiatric examination.  </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3019/2601517788_b2cff93a66_o.jpg" alt="theFall" align="right" height="108" width="241" /><b>September 5, 1951.</b>  Whereas the <a href="/node/134" title="Vanderbilt" target="_blank">Vanderbilt</a> had a habit of killing children, the Rossmere saved them.  Elena Bravo had warned her little Martha, seven, against playing on the third floor fire escape, but Martha didnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t listen and tumbled off, only to be caught by Mrs. Max Casadosâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ground-floor clothesline.  The child suffered a compound arm fracture, a less lamentable situation than another hotel would have afforded.</p>

Morales, 28, delivered a benediction of blood to six of his sleeping children.  And after his sprinkler-like artery-opening anointing act, he beat down a door and chased his wifeâ€”she carrying their nine-month-old babyâ€”and her parents into the street outside the Rossmere with a butcher knife.  When the cops finally arrived at First and Hope they found Morales inside, having slashed his throat with a razor blade.  He was taken to the prison ward at General Hospital.</p>
