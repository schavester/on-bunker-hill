										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>July 14, 1949</p>
<p>Grace E. Smith made the Dome her home.  From there she made the <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=1069071389578867972,34.052220,-118.250030&amp;saddr=201+S+Grand+Ave,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90012&amp;daddr=426+S+Hill+St,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90013&amp;sll=34.052197,-118.251858&amp;sspn=0.009031,0.015814&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=34.052144,-118.252115&amp;spn=0.009031,0.015814&amp;z=16" title="roundaboutway" target="_blank">trek to work</a> down to the Belmont Grill.  Itâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s 1949.  Sheâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s a B-girl.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2010/2362641520_02d623eb9d_o.gif" alt="domeup2ndfromolive" height="350" width="500" /></p>
<p>Vice has been coming down on prosties of late and joints like the Belmont that run B-girl operations are a thorn in the side of decent society.  The racket is simple:  the gals chat up the fellas, and as a gal mingles with the patrons she induces them to buy more drinks.  Her bourbons are colored water or ice tea; she gets a commission of those sales.  And if she takes off with her new friend, weâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />ll call him, oh, John, the tavern owner gets a cut of her earnings.  Repeat.  </p>
<p>After a while Vice gets tired of dealing with pimp beat downs, or customers given the mick finn, so itâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s time to round up the ladies.  Grace E. Smith, 28, wonâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t get to go home to her little room at the Dome tonight, popped as she was at the Belmont for violating the municipal B-girl ordinance.  Tomorrow morning sheâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />ll be out on $100 bail.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2379/2362444800_a5d3bd974c_o.gif" alt="b-elmont" height="416" width="500" /></p>
<p>Grace&#8217;s boss Nathan Bass, owner of the Belmont, has been supbeanoed to testify before the county grand jury in its current vice inquiry into the <a href="https://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,853775,00.html" title="allentown" target="_blank">Brenda Allen</a> police pay-off probe.  (Bass had been in the news last month when he, as a pal of LAPD Lieutenant Wellpott, had wiretaps of his phone calls played at the PD/Allen vice hearings.)  Bass went on to testify that famously dirty Sgts. Stoker and Jackson would meet in the Belmont. </p>
<p>The next mention of Grace E. Smithâ€”one wonders if it&#8217;s she and the sameâ€”is in 1953:  a Lena S. Reed, 72, was to leave her $8,000 estate ($61,857 USD 2007) to her family but just before her demise opted to bequeath it to Mrs. Edna W. â€œMail Fraudâ€ Ballard (aka St. Germain, aka Joan of Arc, aka Lotus Ray King), cofounder of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22I_AM%22_Activity" title="ImNot" target="_blank">I AM</a> religious movement.  A judge blocked probate when the family filed contest, accusing Mrs. Ballard of â€œexerting undue influence on Mrs. Reed while she was in ill health and mentally disturbed.â€  The same accusations were made against the secretary of the organizationâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s St. Germain Foundation, and executor of the will, one Grace E. Smith.</p>
<p>No mention as to whether this Grace E. Smith lived in the Dome.</p>
