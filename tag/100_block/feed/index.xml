										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A glance at mid-century America reveals it emblazoned with the familiar totems:  military might, industrial supremacy, cultural imperialism.  These were carved by fervent if not blind <i>progress</i>, and you”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />d be given a funny look (if not worse) were you to dare question <i>that</i>.  </p>
<p>Nobody would dare bat an eye as freeways forever cut up cities, and huge swaths of our collective memory were lost to parking lots and well-intentioned developments.  Funny old buildings were the realm of <a href="/MunstersofBunkerHill" title="universalmutants" target="_blank">mutants</a>, after all.</p>
<p>But even in the glory days of unquestioned, unfettered forward movement–before, say, Dallas ”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />63 and Watts ”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />65–there was a small rumbling of (not unpatriotic) discontent.  Landmarks were lost hand over fist but when in 1962 it came time for <a href="http://www.nyc-architecture.com/GON/GON004.htm" title="6-5000" target="_blank">Penn Station</a> to become so much New Jersey Medowlands landfill, eyebrows were raised.  This was <i>Penn Station</i>, after all.  Somebody at <i>Life</i> magazine (somebody who ambled through Penn Station to the <i>Life</i> offices at Rockefeller Center, most likely) realized that losing our common heritage would make a nifty nine-page spread.  And so <i>Life</i> called upon heavyweight photojournalist <a href="http://www.getty.edu/art/gettyguide/artMakerDetails?maker=1634" title="WEsnapper" target="_blank">Walker Evans</a> to do the immortalizing.</p>
<p>Walker shot in New York, as well as Norwalk, Conn; Boston and Amesbury, Mass; then out to California for Nevada City, San Francisco, and, in October of 1962, Los Angeles.  Where he made a beeline to Bunker Hill.  He shot all over the Hill but curiously took his greatest number of shots of 101 South Flower, and it was 101 South Flower that made it into the magazine:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3229/3087581193_894f6b9af5_o.gif" alt="FirstFlowerLife" height="553" width="250" /></p>
<p>What can be said of 101-109, aka 101-111 South Flower?  Precious little.  We know that it is announced in February of 1904, to run $16,000 ($364,809 USD 2007).</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3164/3087579775_8a94a883db_o.gif" alt="comingout" height="70" width="463" /></p>
<p>But a thorough check of its various addresses shows that nothing of consequence ever there occurred.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3242/3087579743_4390916b8e_o.gif" alt="towardfront" height="476" width="493" /></p>
<p>The southwest corner of First and Flower:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3036/3088419496_a4e6680a97_o.gif" alt="Sanborn" height="372" width="481" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3293/3088419530_4bfba53849_o.gif" alt="cliffthenogood" align="right" height="111" width="345" />Sure, there was the small matter of Clifford Gooding, who”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />d married his gal Marie and had a daughter with her, only to disappear after a few years.  Marie heard Clifford was dead, and so she remarried, only Clifford wasn”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t dead, just”¦disappeared.  To Bunker Hill.  She lived down on 37th Street; Bunker Hill may as well be the moon.  After six years of Clifford being “deceased” she caught wind that he wasn”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t, had him tracked down, and he was popped at our First &amp; Flower apartment house in November 1925 on a deadbeat dad charge.  That”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s about as racy as it gets; that, and the residents of this particular place had a terrible habit of stepping off of this curb and that into fatally well-built oncoming automobiles.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3061/3088417426_34445e5492_o.gif" alt="101SFautos" height="471" width="486" /></p>
<p>Fortunately what we lack in drama we make up for in image quantity.  It was captured of course by the incomparable Arnold Hylen:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3233/3088417734_a49510c6d0_o.gif" alt="hylen101SF" height="373" width="575" /></p>
<p>Today, of course, the building is demolished, but one isn”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t always expecting to find the same thing to have happened to the <i>street</i>.  Where has all the Flower gone?</p>
<p>In each of the two images below:  First at the top, Second at the bottom, Figueroa at the left (yes, I know Fig is a Street and not an Avenue, that”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Baists for you) Hope on the right.  In the top image, Flower runs down the middle, and there”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s 101 in orange, with “Labarere Tr.” (for Labarere Tract) written across it.  In the modern image below, well Flower just went away.</p>

<p>In writing about the Amesbury, Mass. <a href="http://www.historicnewengland.org/visit/homes/rocky.htm" title="RHMH" target="_blank">Rocky Hill Meeting House</a> <i>Life</i> notes that a proposed expressway is taking down three 18th-century buildings and coming within yards of the structure, which is in a state of <a href="http://www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/collection_database/objectview_altviewenlarge.aspx?page=51&amp;sort=3&amp;sortdir=asc&amp;keyword=&amp;fp=51&amp;dd1=0&amp;dd2=0&amp;vw=1&amp;collID=0&amp;OID=190037903&amp;vT=1&amp;iID=15&amp;iPage=2" title="holyholy" target="_blank">miraculous state</a> of preservation.  This writer does not know if the 1963 worries about blasting and vibrations undermined the building, or played havoc with the 1780s glazing, but I do know that the 495 is now a stone”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s throw away, and I call that wrong.  </p>

After a three-year battle, citizens saved the mansion by referendum; the city ignored this and set out to build the city hall on the mansion grounds <i>again</i>.  Eventually, though, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockwood-Mathews_Mansion" title="mansionwiki" target="_blank">mansion</a> was <a href="http://www.lockwoodmathewsmansion.com/3.html" title="thistimeforawhilewehope" target="_blank">saved</a>, we hope for some time.</p>

<p>And so while the vast majority of the subjects in <i>Life</i>”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s article survived to see another millennium, 101 South Flower did not.  Nor did any of the any other structures shot by Evans that Los Angeles October.</p>

Pompey and his mistress, Mrs. Mitalzo, were out for a stroll on <st1:street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">South Bunker Hill Avenue</st1:address></st1:street>. The dog became increasingly agitated as they drew nearer to a rooming house just up the block. A few doors away from the building, Pompey began to growl. When his hair stood up on end, Mrs. Mitalzo bent over to try to soothe him. She had relaxed her grip on Pompey”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s leash for only a moment, and it was then that Pompey broke free.

The 24 year old Stark had just been discharged from his job as an elevator operator at a downtown hotel. Management had told him that he was through because he didn”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t close the elevator doors properly. The despondent man had taken several newspapers and fashioned them into a long cone. He placed the small end of the improvised suicide device over a gas jet in his room, and he placed the large end over his face. Stark then turned on the gas and lay down to die.

<p style="margin: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">

<p style="margin: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
When Pompey entered the room, Stark was unconscious and near death. The valiant dog dragged the motionless Stark into the safety of the hallway. Mrs. Mitalzo ran into the rooming house to search for Pompey and discovered him watching over the dying man.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Location: 121 North Flower Street</p>
<p>On December 10, 1925, road crew worker W.A. Conway of this address demonstrated exactly how tough were the inhabitants of Bunker Hill. He began the day getting blasted in the head by a misplaced explosive charge on the Edward Lynch property on North Louise Street in Glendale, resuming work after receiving six stitches. Not long after his return, steam shovel engineer Tom Adams told powder man L.J. Starkey to set off a charge of black powder in the hole. The explosion destroyed the steam shovel, sent rocks and debris raining down, and was dropped souffles all over Glendale. Conway was unhurt by this second blast, but we hope he took the hint and found a more careful crew to work with.<br />
 <br />
On January 3, 1935, A.E. Kelly of this address had the dubious distinction of being the agent of death for Harold Wilburn, aged 60, who stepped in front of Kelly&#8217;s automobile at Fifth and Wall Streets.  The accident was explained as caused by the victim being &quot;confused by traffic,&quot; but the location of the incident (the corner anchored by the notorious Hard Rock Cafe) suggests Mr. Wilburn may have been lit up like a Christmas tree before stepping out into oblivion.</p>

Edna Brown, aka Edna Chaplin, aka Mabel Austin, seemed like such a nice girl. Sure, she”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />d been busted by Detective Sergeants Bartley and Allen for stealing $100<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'"><span> </span>($1,271.00 current USD)</span> from O.

When she appeared in Judge Hinshaw”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s court for her arraignment, she burst into tears and appeared to be so genuinely remorseful that Guy Eddy, an attorney who was present on another matter, came to her defense and made a motion to dismiss the case. Judge Hinshaw was also moved by the girl”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s tears, and since Deputy District Attorney Orme made no objections, Edna walked.

A few days following Edna”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s day in court, Detective Sergeants Bartley and Allen were on the trail of a girl who had been accused by J.S. Purdy of using his name to pass bad checks. Purdy told the cops he suspected a girl named Edna. When he was shown a photo of Edna Brown, he immediately identified her as the forger.
