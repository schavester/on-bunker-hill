	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>July 10, 1917</p>
<p>A resident of Bunker Hill was arrested today as part of a secret indictment issued by the Federal grand jury in San Francisco.Â  Ladel P. Varna, aka L. Percy Ram Chandra of 318 S. Flower Street was charged with violating the President&#8217;s neutrality proclamation.Â  He was suspected of being involved in the recent <i>Annie Larsen</i> affair, part of a &quot;wholesale plot to assist the Hindus in an effort to throw off the British yoke.&quot;</p>
<p>The affair, and the trial that followed is too hopelessly confusing to relate here in any detail, but involved &quot;German spies,&quot; the Irish Republican Brotherhood, and India&#8217;s Ghadar Party.Â  The <i>Annie Larsen</i>, a barely seaworthy vessel, was loaded up with approximately 4 million round of ammunition, 3758 cases of small arms ammunition, 10,000 Springfield rifles, 10,000 bayonets, and 10,000 cartridge belts, and sent out to rendezvous with the <i>Maverick</i>, and transfer the cargo to the larger ship, which would then head for Southeast Asia. </p>
<p>But back to Bunker Hill for now&#8230;</p>
<p>A graduate of Delhi University, Varna had lived in the United States for about four years at the time of his arrest.Â  When he arrived in San Francisco, he operated a fruit stand that did enough business to allow him to save up his money and purchase some real estate around Berkeley.Â  Then, two and a half years ago, Varna moved to Los Angeles and took a job in a cafeteria on Fourth Street.Â  He lived in a room at 318 S. Flower with four other men, and spoke perfect English</p>
<p>Of the charges brought against him, Varna said, &quot;I know nothing about it except as the complain was read to me.Â  It is all like a dream to me.Â  I was in no conspiracy to violate the laws of this country and can bring witnesses to show what I have been doing ever since I landed.Â  I have saved some money, but do not like to spend it on a lawyer.Â  I won&#8217;t hire an attorney.&quot;</p>
<p>Varna had recently registered for military service, and said that he was wiling to go to war for the United States if he was called.Â </p>

<p>For many, the tragedy of Bunker Hill was seeing Victorian structures that had survived more than half a century torn down in the blink of an eye. While many homes did survive for up to eight decades, others like the <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/node/86" title="Crocker Mansion">Crocker Mansion</a> had somewhat abbreviated lives, lasting a mere thirty years or so. The E.P. Bryan residence at 333 S. Grand, however, might possibly win the award for shortest existence of a mansion on Bunker Hill.</p>

<p>Elden P. Bryan was a Texan who landed in Los Angeles in 1886 and made a fortune in real estate, most notably selling H.E. Huntington his first piece of property. Around 1890, the Bryan family decided to reside in the quickly developing Bunker Hill neighborhood and construction began at 333 S. Grand Avenue. A superstitious man, Bryan allegedly halted construction and altered architectural plans numerous times to suit his paranoia. The finished product was an elegant home with two sets of stairs leading up to the front door. One set was made up of fourteen steps and the other twelve, deliberately designed to avoid the unlucky number thirteen. The real estate baron and his wife, Georgie, entertained other prominent Los Angeles folk at the residence, frequently receiving coverage in the society column</p>

</div>
<p>
In 1904, Bryan was developing the Westmoreland Tract in the Wilshire-Pico District and construction commenced on an eighteen room home by architect Charles F Whittlesey, who incorporated his trademark reinforced concrete into the design. It is unknown if Bryan left Bunker Hill because Westmoreland was more fashionable or because he felt the Grand Ave residence to be unlucky after all. By 1906, the Bryan family had moved into their palatial new quarters and the home on Bunker Hill was gone, replaced by the Fleur-de-Lis Apartments and another house. The E.P. Bryan Residence has existed for approximately fourteen years.</p>
<p>Perhaps the superstitious homeowner had been onto something. In the ensuing years, many residents of the building that replaced the short lived mansion would suffer severe misfortunes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1907, John Harding was half a block away from his Grand Ave lodgings, when he was beaten within an inch of his life in a case of mistaken identity. Another resident, P.J. Sinclair, had been out of work for sometime before he decided to end it all by swallowing poison in 1938. Several days went by before his body was discovered inside the boarding house, along with the suicide note that read &quot;I have not got the nerve or conscience to be a crook and under the present conditions it is better to die than to live.&quot; In 1932, Everett R. Todd thought jumping out the window of his room a preferable way to end it all. His reasons according to the letter he left behind were &quot;the suffering I am causing so many people and because of nervousness.&quot; Then there was C.L. Devont, who was despondent over a failed marriage in 1934 when she shot herself in the heart . At least she was thoughtful enough to write a farewell note, leaving all her possessions to her estranged husband.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</div>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t all gloom and doom at the Fleur-de-Lis Apartments, later known as the Capitol Hotel. In 1937, residents were involved in a 1,200 person written protest, objecting to the City Council&#8217;s proposal to replace <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/angelsflight" title="Angels Flight">Angels Flight</a> with an elevator. The building also held the distinguished honor of housing Los Angeles&#8217; shortest man, Angelo Rossitto, who was two feet eleven inches tall.</p>
<p>By 1962, &quot;progress&quot; had come to Bunker Hill and the Capitol Hotel went the way of its Victorian predecessor. </p>

		<p>Location: 350 Clay Street<br>
Date: June 3, 1946</p>
<p>In the not-quite-twelve hours since John M. Kelly was discharged from the Marine Corps, he somehow took up with Henry Ehlert, 44, and Dwight C. Lester, 23, of this address and John Graham, 43, a Naval chief petty officer stationed in San Diego.</p>
<p>Kelly&#8217;s first night as a civilian was a notable one: he and his pals drew the attention of Traffic Officer F.J. Rees, investigating reports of a holdup in an alley between Main and Spring, and when Kelly made a funny move when ordered to put &#8217;em up, Rees shot half his face off.</p>
<p>Kelly survived long enough to be booked on robbery charges in the prison ward of General Hospital, while his pals cooled their heels in County Jail. But the lack of any follow up to this story makes one wonder if Rees had an itchy finger, and the arrests were meant to cover up an accidental shooting of an innocent man. </p>
<p>The previous November 10, hapless Dwight C. Lester, then residing at 300 S. Olive Street, somehow lost his footing, fell under the up-bound Angels Flight car and was dragged about 60 feet before engineer Elmer Miller heard him hollering and braked. He escaped with friction burns and lacerations. Below, a photograph of his rescue.<br>

<p>John Roebling tells police that as far as his confused memory can be relied on, a man and a young woman clad in boy&#8217;s clothing chloroformed him in his room and relieved him of $20 before fleeing in a car. We cannot but suspect the full story is more interesting, and regret Mr. Roebling&#8217;s discretion.</p>

<p>The demise of Bunker Hill conjures up image of bull dozers doing the bidding of the Community Redevelopment Agency, leveling the landscape of the once colorful and picturesque neighborhood. While the CRA&#8217;s master plan dealt the final blow to Bunker Hill, the demolition of victorian structures in the area had been taking place for decades. The Brunson Mansion at the corner of Fourth Street and Grand Avenue was an imposing structure that seemed destined to stand indefinitely. Instead it would last less than four decades and become an early victim of the City&#8217;s obsession with the automobile. </p>
<p>The residence known as the Brunson Mansion was built in the early 1880s by Judge Anson Brunson who resided on the bench of the Los Angeles County Superior Court before stepping down to serve as a lawyer for the lucrative Santa Fe Rail Road. According to the L.A. Times, the residence was “a dark red house, large, compact, dignified, in the center of sloping lawns walled up above the level of three streets.”&#157; The house was so large it had a Bunker Hill Avenue and a Grand Avenue address, before settling on 347 South Grand as its official label.</p>
<div style="text-align: center">
<img src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2148/2469410203_9338e82a6a.jpg?v=0" alt="Brunson Headline" width="300">
</div>
<p>
The Judge resided at the home with his wife Angela until the early 1890s when details of his torrid affair with the widow of a Civil War General came to light. In December 1892, Mrs. Brunson filed for divorce on the grounds of desertion, extreme cruelty and adultery. She was supposedly in possession of hotel registers and love letters, one of which read like “an extract from a French novel,”&#157; documenting the relationship  between her 60 year old husband and Mrs. General George Stoneman, 10 years his junior. The Judge had left the Grand Ave property and taken up residence on Flower Street and Mrs. Brunson stayed in the mansion until she was forced to sell it in 1894. While Judge Brunson denied the existence of a romantic relationship between him and Mrs. Stoneman, when he died in October 1894, he left all his possessions to  “my dear and faithful friend, Mary O.H. Stoneman.”&#157; Years after the mansion was long gone, locals felt that the “ghosts of unhappinesses remained there,”&#157; haunted by “the husband and wife who for years lived as strangers under the same stately roof.”&#157;</p>

</div>
<p>One of the mansion&#8217;s next owners was Dr. B.F. Church, who with his wife, used part of the house as their residence where numerous social gatherings were held. The doctor converted the other part of the house into the short-lived Los Angeles Eye, Ear &amp; Throat Hospital aka The Eye and Ear Infirmary until 1901. Eighteen years later, B.F. Church, who had suffered years of mental problems, would throw himself out of an office window at 7th and Grand, plummeting to his death in front of a lunchtime crowd. </p>
<p>In the early years of the new Century, the 18 room property became the Hotel Brunson. Its thirteen years as a boarding house would see little incident other than almost getting burned down by a wayward firecracker in 1904, and the shooting of a burglar by a hotel resident in 1909 (the police followed the trail of blood and apprehended the suspect at his nearby home).</p>

</div>
<p>By 1917, the automobile had come to Bunker Hill and the owners of the property at 347 South Grand decided that a two story brick garage would be more lucrative than a hotel. In April of that year, the furnishings of the Brunson Hotel were auctioned off, and stately structure which was once a “show place of the city”&#157; was demolished and replaced by an auto mechanic.</p>

<p>Before the Community Redevelopment Association swung its scythe across Bunker Hill, one building tried to do itself in.  This structure was by all evidence a living, cursed thing, and like the <a href="https://www.bartleby.com/195/10.html" title="starringvincentprice" target="_blank">House of Usher</a> disappearing into the tarn, it acted to remove itself from this world.  Shades of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlook_Hotel" title="timberlineonclay" target="_blank">Overlook Hotel</a>—someone or something used the old exploding boiler trick to force this assembly of apartments from its supramortal coil.</p>
<p>I speak of the Hotel Central, aka the Clayton Apartments, aka the Lorraine Hotel.  Change the names all you want, there’s something wrong at 310 Clay Street.  Kim’s numerous posts about the place attest to <i>that</i>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2062/2459037241_09f29cfc22_o.gif" alt="gagschool" align="right" height="152" width="281"><br>
The spot was a trouble magnet even before the hotel’s erection.  Back when 310 was a double dwelling, it attracted kerchief-weilding lady-gagging <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/anightvisitor" title="nightvis" target="_blank">burglars</a>. </p>
<p>By 1910 the Hotel Lorraine stands on the site and <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/goingtobakersfield" title="foundincatalina" target="_blank">Jerome Hite</a> elects to shoot his wife in the neck. </p>
<p>Come 1914, proprietor-of-the-place Claude Mathewson—gets, what, tired of watching the walls bleed? listening to the screaming faces jutting from the washbasin mirror?—elects to pop two new holes into his <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/nelliebuck" title="mathewson" target="_blank">lovely wife</a> and one into his own head. </p>
<p>Shortly after, in that room where try as one might the blood just never quite washes out, a real estate titan is <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/inthedeathroom" title="deathroom" target="_blank">taken down</a> for sordidness. </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2268/2460241029_8700ac72d5_o.gif" alt="goodstart" align="left" height="115" width="266"><br>
A year later, the establishment, now named the Clayton, has become a <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/redlightraid" title="veritabledenItellyou" target="_blank">veritable den of iniquity</a>.  The new proprietor is a Mrs. Florence Cheney.  According to her, the property is owned by Leon Levy, “about whom no one concerned could give any information.”&#157;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2213/2459037211_e2acd7a6f9_o.gif" alt="goodstart" height="300" width="250"></p>

Mrs. Cheney shows up again as a witness in the 1916 Percy Tugwell trial; Percy robbed and murdered Senator’s-daughter Maud Kennedy, and while Mrs. Cheney asserted that Maud may have committed suicide because she was being threatened by boxer Louis “Cyclone Thompson”&#157; Astosky, her character and thus credibility were attacked mercilessly.</p>
<p>Leon Levy decides to get out of the 310 Clay business after changing its name again to the Hotel Central.</p>
<p>Things stay quiet at 310 Clay for the next couple decades or so&#8230;acts of ill fortune befall its residents elsewhere.  <br>
<img loading="lazy" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2318/2460094159_73201637f6_o.gif" alt="maceydayparade" height="176" width="248"><br>

In 1922, for example, Frank Macey, son of a wealthy Phoenix shoe dealer, dropped from sight for a week after staying in the Central.  He ended up as a nameless bloody pulp in County Hospital, hovering in and out of consciousness, until at last identified as the prodigal Frank.  </p>
<p>In 1923, Sander Serrano, 22 year-old graduate of USC, was playing pool at <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=155+E+1st+St,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90012&amp;sll=34.051842,-118.242846&amp;sspn=0.009031,0.014527&amp;layer=c&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=34.053033,-118.242846&amp;spn=0.009031,0.014527&amp;t=h&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr&amp;cbll=34.051814,-118.242843" title="thewatersfine" target="_blank">155 East First</a> when he was accused of jostling another player.  For this he nearly lost his arm to his penknife-wielding opponent, who severed a slew of arteries and stabbed him in the throat.</p>

<p>And so it goes, until the hotel could take no more, or had claimed enough souls, or something otherwise unknowable to mere man.</p>

Mid-day, November 27, 1953.  O. B. Reeder, a 73 year-old retired printer, was bent over a table preparing Christmas gifts for mailing.  Houses of Hell hating the Christmas season and all, the boiler exploded in rage, sending Reeder’s door across the room and into his back.  Directly across the hall, from where resident Gus Poulas’ guardian angel had guided him elsewhere, the room was completely wrecked, all tumbled furniture and great cakes of plaster torn from the walls.  </p>
<p>The boiler room itself was obliterated into a mass of twisted metal and piles of timber and concrete wall blocks.  Plaster from walls and ceilings was concussed to floors throughout the hotel.   The windows and doors in the first three floors were cracked or blown out by the explosion, which attracted a large lunchtime crowd of spectators to the Hill Street section of the Grand Central Market.  (The back of the hotel towered over a Hill St. parking lot:)<br>

Making the incident all the eerier is owner/manager William Ogawa’s statement that while the boilers were under repair, he was certain that gas to the boiler room had been turned off when the boilers went out of order several days previous.</p>
<p>In any event, everything was rebuilt, doors rehung, windows reglazed.  Less than a decade later the scythe swung and all that was 310 Clay was at the bottom of a landfill, the CRA accomplishing what the Lorraine/Clayton/Central couldn’t do itself.</p>
<p>But remember what I said about the spot being a trouble magnet even before the hotel’s erection?  Is there some sort of Poltergeist-style burial-ground whatnot at work here?  Flash forward a hundred years from our tale of the simple double residence. </p>
<p>310 Clay at lucky number 13:</p>

<p>On that very spot.  February 1, 2001.  What spanner of the underworld was <a href="https://juniperhills.net/elegyfortwoangels.html" title="thereaping" target="_blank">tossed into</a> the heavenly works of a newly-located Angels Flight? </p>
<p>This is the ground zero of Clay Street.  Clay Street, the street that had to be destroyed.  The street whose very name—<i>clay</i>—symbolizes (via Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s dream) the division of an empire, and the end of a kingdom.</p>

		<p>May 22, 1919<br>317 S. Flower Street, Saratoga Hotel<br><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3285/2451419572_874aba1a1a_o.jpg" alt="saratogahotel" align="left" height="65" width="268">A building permit for a 3-story brick lodging house that would become the Saratoga Hotel was issued to W.W. Paden and Louis Nordlinger in the summer of 1914.  A year later, the hotel was offered for sale, exchange, or lease, offering &quot;long lease, good furniture, and cheap rent.&quot;</p>
<p>By 1919, the hotel had already acquired something of a reputation, and was home to many show business types.  On May 22, A.W. Gifford, head of the City&#8217;s Purity Squad led a raid on the hotel and arrested 32 people on charges of living in a house of prostitution.  Members of the Purity Squad had taken rooms at the Saratoga during the week prior to the raid, and gathered evidence during that time.</p>
<p>Police tore apart the Saratoga&#8217;s 200 rooms, confiscated hundreds of bottles of liquor and beer, and questioned all occupants.  Anyone who could not prove steady employment, and any man and woman found together in the same room without a marriage license were taken to City Jail.</p>
<p>Many of those arrested said they worked in the movies as extras, but police determined that &quot;extra work is not considered real work.&quot;</p>
<p>The next day, however, 22 of those arrested were released without charges.  The owner of the hotel, Charles H. Price of Monrovia, assumed responsibility, and promised to install a new building manager in an agreement forged with City Prosecutor Widney.  Widney explained away the releases, claiming that the raids were staged merely &quot;to break up certain conditions believed to exist.&quot;</p>
<p>So, it wasn&#8217;t a whorehouse&#8230; but it might have turned into one if left unchecked.  Thanks Purity Squad!</p>
<p>An angry letter to the editor followed on the heels of the raid, signed only &quot;Justice.&quot;  It read:</p>
<p><i>&quot;How is a stranger, a girl alone in a strange city, for instance, to know positively that she is in a respectable neighborhood or house?  She may have places recommended by the YMCA, the YWCA, the Bible Institute, and yet find herself in an undesirable location.  Nobody can be certain.</i></p>
<p><i>What do you think of five men in civilian clothes with no badges or authority &#8212; or, at least none visible &#8212; bursting into the room of a girl at an unseemly hour, insulting her, accusing her of crime, when she knows absolutely nothing of the reason for such an assault&#8230; Do you think five ruffians like that, cowards, would do so if a man were in the room with a gun?  Hardly.&quot; </i></p>

<p>The mansions of Bunker Hill were sometimes inhabited by colorful characters who provided the neighborhood with mayhem, madness or just plain entertainment. Others, like the Hildreth Mansion at the corner of Fourth and Hope led a peaceful, if sometimes melancholy existence, standing as the graceful pillar of a lost era until the wrecking balls came. </p>
<p>The residence that stood at 357 South Hope Street for over sixty years was built by Reverend Edward T. Hildreth, a Congregational minister and graduate of the Chicago Theological Seminary. Built in 1889 and designed by JC Newsom, the defining features of the Victorian Shingle style home were an ornate chimney and wrought iron circular balcony on the tower. Located at the northwest corner of the intersection, the exterior of the elevated house was finished off with a stone retaining wall and steps leading up the entrance.</p>
<p><img src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2351/2449717155_8f0bbd0356.jpg?v=0" alt="Hildreth Mansion" width="300"> <img src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2346/2450542716_3d06997a44.jpg?v=0" alt="Hildreth Mansion" width="300"></p>
<p>
Happiness in the Hildreth household was short lived. In 1893, the Reverend&#8217;s youngest son Richard drowned in a nearby watering hole, and his body was brought back to the family residence after it was recovered. Edward and his wife Sarah soon made plans to donate an organ to the First Congregational Church as a memorial to their son, but instead the gift came to commemorate mother and child when Sarah suddenly died in October 1895. Reverend Hildreth never completely recovered from the double loss, and the beloved minister was cared for by his daughter Faith until he passed away at the Hope Street residence in 1907. One year later, the Reverend&#8217;s young daughter/caretaker died inside the house of an undisclosed illness.</p>

</div>
<p>The mansion soon became a boarding house and stenographers, salesmen, teachers, real estate agents, carpenters, janitors, iron workers, seamstresses and many others passed through its doors. By 1939, the eighteen rooms of the house had been converted into nine residences. Boarders paid between thirteen and thirty-five dollars a month in rent and had lived in the mansion anywhere from one to twelve years. With the exception of the eighty-seven year old resident who was killed in an auto accident in 1940, the boarders of the once stately home lived a quiet existence and dried laundry on the grand wrought iron balcony.</p>
<p>By 1954, the Hildreth Mansion was but a beautiful memory, destroyed by the CRA&#8217;s visions of urban renewal.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Location: 360 South Hill Street<br>
Date: September 15, 1910</p>
<p>The anonymous rooming house cyanide suicide seemed calculated to deliver himself into an unmarked pauper&#8217;s grave, but a last impulse led him to pen a letter of farewell to his mother. He did not name her, but addressed the envelope with their hometown, <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?ie=UTF8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;q=Benkelman,+NE,+USA&amp;ll=40.05311,-101.531525&amp;spn=0.028973,0.069351&amp;t=h&amp;z=14&amp;iwloc=addr" target="_blank">Benkelman, Nebraska</a>. A telegraph to the postmaster of that burg soon brought the reply: the dead man was one Judson Graves, 35, from a good family but for some time bumming broke around the west. His sorrowful mother has asked Dr. Lockwood of Pasadena to go to Pierce Brothers and claim the body, and ship it home for burial.</p>

<p>Following his breakfast at the little cafe at 309 S. Flower Street, 25-year-old James D. Bland was full of bacon, eggs, and bad intentions.</p>
<p>He was not armed, but pantomimed a weapon under his coat, and threatened to shoot the waitress, Heide Ogawa, unless she emptied the register.  Bland also herded three other cafe employees into a back storage room.</p>
<p>Ogawa handed over the restaurant&#8217;s $18 take, and then, for reasons known perhaps only to himself, Bland decided to free the other employees before making his departure.</p>
<p>There are two versions of what happened next, but both make for pretty good stories.</p>
<p>According to police, a Negro dishwasher named Arthur Sanders bashed Bland over the head with the handle of a meat cleaver when he was on his way out the door.  Then, while Bland was unconscious, the cafe employees tied him up with cords from a laundry bag, and waited for help.</p>
<p>However, at his court date, it was reported that after Bland released the other employees, Ogawa saw her chance and gave him a good shove.  Bland lost his balance and stumbled into the arms of a cook, who shoved him in a laundry bag and tied it shut.</p>
<p>Bland entered a guilty plea to second degree robbery and was sentenced to 5 years probation and 1 year in County Jail.</p>
