										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today On Bunker Hill is proud to present another little something special from the archives of George Mann, an artifact that predates his astonishing <a href="/georgemannshop" target="_blank">color photographs</a> of Bunker Hill by about thirty years.</p>
<p>Before he came up to the hill to take pictures, George was half of the comedic vaudeville dance team Barto &amp; Mann. In 1928, he filmed his friend W.C. Fields in that comic performer&#8217;s headlining role in the Earl Carroll Vanities, at Carroll&#8217;s 7th Avenue Manhattan theater. Barto &amp; Mann were also on the bill.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Mormon&#8217;s Prayer&#8221; was an opportunity to highlight the famously stunning Carroll showgirls (choreographed by Busby Berkeley) while giving the urban audience a chance to snicker at the erotic excesses of backwoods believers. We&#8217;re truly thrilled to present to you this lost moment of American theater history, as a follow-up to the newly discovered color George Mann footage of the <a href="/threestooges" target="_blank">Three Stooges</a> at Atlantic City.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d_3SVBSd9R0" width="640" height="480" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Fields was paid $5200 a week for his several appearances during the show, which culminated in an outrageous routine, &#8220;Episode at the Dentist&#8217;s&#8221; (later expanded and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmCp-EGBsbY" target="_blank">filmed</a>) in which flying teeth and whirring drills terrorized and delighted the packed house. Among Dr. Pain&#8217;s (Fields) &#8220;victims&#8221; was the gorgeous, half-naked and dumb-as-a-post star of the Vanities, Dorothy Knapp (&#8220;The Most Beautiful Girl in the World&#8221;). We will refrain from any crass remarks about wishing to &#8220;drill&#8221; her.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today On Bunker Hill is proud to present another little something special from the archives of George Mann, an artifact that predates his astonishing <a href="/georgemannshop" target="_blank">color photographs</a> of Bunker Hill by about thirty years.</p>
<p>If you enjoyed the <a href="/wcfields" target="_blank">recent posting</a> of George&#8217;s silent footage of W.C. Fields on stage as a worried Mormon husband about to hop into the sack with a bevy of Earl Carroll showgirls, you&#8217;ll thrill to see the lively home movie footage of Fields yucking it up with a tennis racket, filmed when both performers were appearing in the Earl Carroll Vanities.</p>
<p>You met him here first, but our pal George Mann is becoming quite the internet sensation. Critic Leonard Maltin <a href="https://blogs.indiewire.com/leonardmaltin/real-faux-silent-footage-worth-watching" target="_blank">dedicated</a> much of a recent blog post to Mann&#8217;s rediscovered silent film footage of Fields and the Three Stooges.</p>
<p>Keeping watching this space, as there more amazing short films coming from the George Mann Archives, starring some incredible entertainers. And for now&#8230; more Bill Fields!</p>
