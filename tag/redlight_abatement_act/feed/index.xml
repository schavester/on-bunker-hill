										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Location: 310 Clay Street<br />
Date: June 15, 1915</p>
<p>The Redlight Abatement Act is now law, and the first establishment to be entered by crowbar, ax and the strong arms of police and DA&#8217;s men was the Hotel Clayton, formerly the Lorraine. The authorities interrupted a gay midnight dinner party and made prisoners of all 25 inside, including some panic-stricken ladies who begged to be turned loose as their husbands didn&#8217;t know they were out. In all, 17 men and 8 women were seized.</p>
<p>Among those arrested, 75-year-old proprietress Mrs. Florence Cheney (held on $5000 bail for pandering and $2000 for contributing to her 16-year-old granddaughter Florence Emery&#8217;s delinquency). Florence is now in the hands of juvenile authorities and her mother Ella Emery is being held on vagrancy charges. </p>
<p>Also arrested were Special Officers W.C. Becker and A.S. Ross of the Nick Harris Detective Agency, both in the process of devouring sandwiches and claiming to be doing some investigating of their own, attorney Chauncey Gardner, who refused any comment, a fellow named Jones who had no trousers, and a number of people named Smith or Jones. All came before Police Judge Frederickson and were bailed at $50 each after pleasing not guilty, save Mrs. Cheney, jailed on the statutory charges, and the two detectives, released on their own recognizance.</p>
<p>When the place was called the Lorraine it was site of the murder of the notorious Nellie Buck, Hite&#8217;s shooting of his wife and several suicides, and seems to still be a place of notable ill favor.</p>
