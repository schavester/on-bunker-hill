<p>The next time you take in a show at the Ahmanson Theater or the Mark Taper Forum, take a minute and think about the St Angelo Hotel. For 70 years the impressive Victorian structure dominated the corner of Grand and Temple where the Music Center now stands. From stately hotel to slum boarding house, the St Angelo represented Bunker Hill in all its glory and decline.</p>
<div style="text-align: center">
<img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3273/2585744865_34d4897a32.jpg?v=0" alt="St Angelo in its glory days" width="400">
</div>
<p>
The St. Angelo Hotel was built in 1887 by a Mrs. A.M. Smith who hoped to cash in on the big SoCal land boom of the 1880s, which brought countless migrants to the area. Like many structures built on the Hill during this period, the St Angelo was an elaborate Victorian building that the Los Angeles Times described as having “balconies with ornate woodwork and varicolored small squares of glass are in the upper parts of the windows.”&#157; As for the interior, the St. Angelo had “winding stairways which with other woodwork are of redwood”&#157; with “wide landings that are parlors on each floor.”&#157;  </p>
<div style="text-align: center">

</div>
<p></p>
<p>Unfortunately, Mrs. Smith&#8217;s timing was a bit off. When the St. Angelo opened, the booming 80s were winding down and the hotel did not fare as well as planned. In August 1889, the hotel was shut down by the sheriff due to an attachment on the property, but was able to reopen three months later. Mrs. Smith held onto the hotel for twelve years, waiting for prosperous times to return, but ultimately had to give up the property.</p>

</div>
<p>Prosperity did come to the St Angelo in the early years of the 20th Century and the hotel hosted many parties, weddings and conferences. Guests were frequently mentioned in the society pages. While the patrons of  the St. Angelo may have been of a more refined type, the same could not always be said of its employees. For example, there was no love lost between Mr. Cole, the hotel cook, and Mr. Brown another hotel employee, who were known to frequently spar. One day in March of 1902, all hell broke lose and Brown and Cole chased each other around the kitchen throwing, “catsup bottles, dining-room chairs, and other utensils that came handy.”&#157; The authorities were summoned and Brown was fined $5. </p>
<p>In 1904, Mrs. A.M. Smith came back in the picture when she realized that she legally still retained, as the L.A. Times reported, a strip of land “seven and one half feet, extending from Grand avenue to Bunker Hill avenue and passing directly under the St. Angelo.”&#157; The property owners demanded that she hand over the deed to this strip of land, but Mrs. Smith held out for the cash settlement. She finally made a profit on the St. Angelo.</p>

<p>No boarding house on Bunker Hill would be complete without a bit of death and mayhem. In 1906, Charles Malan, a Frenchman suffering from consumption and depleted funds, did himself in by sealing off all the doors and cracks of his room and turning on the gas. Then there is the sad story of Frederick Merrill, an 87 year old inventor and resident who slipped on a banana peel on Main Street and died from his injuries a couple of weeks later. Finally, in 1943 a fight broke out in the hotel&#8217;s lobby and Mrs. Mae Perry, the hotel manager, broke up the scuffle&#8230;with a gun. Rubio Ernesto, 17 and not a hotel guest was killed in the incident. </p>

<p>
By 1939, when a WPA census was conducted, the St. Angelo and its 57 units were in need of “major repairs.”&#157; As the Los Angeles Times noted, “it is an old wooden pile now proudly in decline, a genteel old building still snobbish among the smaller structures around it which were built not much later.”&#157; Despite the hotel&#8217;s shabby condition, it stood proudly on the Hill until the board of health ordered it vacated in 1956. All traces of the once grand hotel were soon erased and replaced by the Music Center which was dedicated in 1964. </p>

Who fought City Hall; who fought the law, and sure, the law won.   But let‘s remember the man.  Firebrand.  Gadfly.  Babcock.</p>
<p>It‘s 1951, and we‘re faced with Proposition C, which sounded just <i>swell</i>:  clear the city‘s slum areas and replace “ramshackle”&#157; tenements with modern apartments.  The Times ran large pieces urging the voters to back C, citing a litany of political, business and union leaders supporting the measure (veterans‘ organizations termed the measure “a solution of a vital civic problem in the American way”&#157;).</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3187/2561698214_4c31b4a0b1_o.gif" alt="poopC" align="right" height="178" width="242">But one fellow didn‘t think the idea so all-American–owner of <a href="/theDome" title="thedome" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Dome</a>, president of the Bunker Hill Property Owners Association, Frank Babcock.  The Association met before the election and passed a resolution announcing their opposition to Prop C (which would raze Bunker Hill, to be replaced by “12 blocks of new apartment houses”&#157;) whereby property owners would be forced to sell at condemnation prices; BHPOA also saw C as a scheme to take their property for the benefit of insurance corporations.  Be that as it may, the voters decided Proposition C was the American Way (despite the Stalinist overtones of a government taking private property) and it passed.  But you hadn‘t heard the last of Frank Babcock.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important not to confuse our Frank Babcock with the anti-Babcock, or Babcock-Bizarro, if you will.  Henry Babcock.  Whether they‘re related we do not know, but it does tickle the imagination to think so.  Why?  Because Henry Babcock had been involved in the wholesale demolition of Bunker Hill since 1930.  He arrived in Los Angeles from Chicago as one of William Babcock &amp; Sons, real estate valuators and consultants, to study the feasibility of the “Bigelow Plan”&#157; (C. C. Bigelow‘s 1928 scheme for removing the Hill using hydraulic mining equipment) and how quickly a regraded Bunker Hill could be absorbed into downtown.  Henry Babcock in-a-nutshell:</p>

“There is no community, it is found, that is entirely free from spots or sections that by reason of antiquated structures, topographical conditions or congestion have depreciated in value and also are having an adverse effect on adjacent areas.  This is on the principle of the spoiled apple in the barrel.  In fact, directly or indirectly, these depreciated areas threaten a bad effect on entire municipalities.<br>
“They cannot by fenced off and left to their fate.  They cannot be segregated to work out their own salvation regardless of the rest of the community.  Consequently they present a problem of concern to the entire city in which they are situated.  Naturally, the rehabilitation of blighted areas is governed entirely by the conditions involved.<br>
“In the instance of Bunker Hill the matter of topography enters largely into consideration.  Admittedly it is a traffic barrier not only for itself but for extensive and growing sections at every side of it.  Architecturally it has not kept pace with the modernly growing parts of the city.  It apparently presents a striking need for rehabilitation if it is to share in the indicated improvement in realty values.  Modern engineering methods lend themselves expeditiously to the razing of this are or any part of it and without undue interference with a natural volume of traffic with the work is under way.”&#157;
</div>
<p>Babcock, after presenting a ninety-six page report about razing and regrading Bunker Hill to the City Council, decided to stay in Los Angeles as a vice-president of the Mitchel-Brown &amp; Co. Spring-Street investment house.</p>
<p>Then, there was to be a Babcockfight.  Henry Babcock shows up again in 1951 as a consulting engineer for Proposition C.  He outdoes the CRA by drawing up plans for <i>thirty-seven</i> thirteen-story apartment complexes on 73 acres, four 600-car parking garages, and open paved lots for 2560 autos.  Parking and retail buildings were to be located in the center of Bunker Hill.</p>
<p>In February of 1955 Frank Babcock strolled down from his Dome to Superior Court and slapped the Community Redevelopment Agency with an injunction to block the development  (the City, and all the members of the City Council [with the exception of Edward R. Roybal, who‘d voted against BH redevelopment] were also named as defendants). <br>
<img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3048/2561500125_c8d23b3839_o.gif" alt="councilready" align="left" height="225" width="179"><br>
Babcock asserted that the law was clear:  the CRA could only demolish blighted areas.  The structures and set-up of Bunker Hill, Babcock argued, met City ordinances‘ standards and filled the economic needs of the community, and further contended that (despite common belief and <a href="http://www.allanguthrie.co.uk/5/paul_cain.htm" title="bhnoir" target="_blank" rel="noopener">literary assertions</a> to the contrary) Bunker Hill‘s buildings were safe for occupancy, not conducive to ill health, transmission of disease, juvenile delinquency, infant mortality or crime.  And, owner of the Dome that he was, was proud to say that landowners on the Hill were planning development of their own properties and had no need for the “aid”&#157; of 40million+ condemnation dollars in taxpayer funds.</p>
<p>By June of 1956, William T. Sesnon, armed with Henry Babcock‘s financial, economic and architectural surveys, presented final plans to the City Council.  As required by law, there was a public hearing; Frank Babcock presented his alternate proposals–lost to time, now.  It would seem there was nothing Frank Babcock could do to stem the tide that would wash away Bunker Hill and his beloved Dome.  Until he realized that tide was suffused with <i>brea</i>.  </p>

Sesnon Jr., chairman of the Community Redevelopment Agency, is an oil magnate, after all.  (&#8216;Twas he who proposed the plan to finance homes for those elderly residents who had to be relocated from Bunker Hill:  the City would drill on property bounded by <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=W+Temple+St+%26+E+Edgeware+Rd,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90026&amp;sll=34.067592,-118.256364&amp;sspn=0.008994,0.013304&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=34.067592,-118.254647&amp;spn=0.008994,0.013304&amp;t=h&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr" title="oilfield" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Temple</a>, Beverly, Union and Edgeware–one of LA‘s oldest oilfields–and the senior-citizen property owners would receive a one-sixth royalty interest with which they could pay their new rents.)  And Sesnon wanted Bunker Hill for its mineral rights, you see.  And Babcock could prove it were he able to inspect the Agency‘s books and records, a request he‘d been repeatedly denied.  On June 23, 1958 Babcock demanded the issuance of a writ of mandate to compel the agency to allow him access.  If the idea of oil beneath Bunker Hill sounds nutty, it‘s not; but we won‘t go into our petroleum reservoir wherefores here.  Babcock should have restrained himself when he charged that the City Council was in on the conspiracy, though.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3079/2562385432_288c142f94_o.gif" alt="thelash" height="63" width="355"></p>

These charges are irresponsible, malicious, vindictive and utterly false.  No member of the Council ever entered into such a deal.  It is an outrage that we have to face such publicity and I completely resent such statements.”&#157;</p>
<p>Alas, that‘s the last we hear of Frank Babcock.  Henry Babcock is mentioned one more time, in August of 1958, testifying before the City Council about the estimated value of a regraded Hill.</p>
<p>The Babcocks go on to watch as the CRA, bit by bit, commandeers umpteen millions from City coffers, displaces 9,000 people, and eventually gobbles up 136 acres.  In the Autumn of 1961 the first CRA-demo‘d building goes down–the Hillcrest.  Frank Babcock‘s Dome stands proud until she burns in the Summer of ‘64.  </p>
<p>Henry Babcock‘s city of apartment buildings on the Hill never quite materializes the way he planned it.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">T</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">he second hour of January 1, 1903 had just begun, and New Year”&#x2122;s Eve revelers were still celebrating in the streets of the city.<span>  </span>Three friends; <span> </span>J.F. Jones, S.M. Schoonover, and Elsie Stahl were standing on an upper floor balcony of the Lincoln Hotel, enjoying each other”&#x2122;s company as well as the sights and sounds of nearby parties. They were unaware that beneath them on the sidewalk in front of the hotel, there were three young men; Lauren Hanna, John G. Todd, and W.W. Burton, who had decided to ring in the New Year by sending a fusillade of bullets into space. Todd and <place w:st="on"><city w:st="on">Burton</city></place> were firing blanks, but Hanna”&#x2122;s pistol was loaded with live rounds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">The young men may have been drinking, or perhaps they were just too dumb to comprehend the consequences of blindly firing weapons above their heads into the pitch black sky. The initial burst of gunfire apparently did no harm, but the second round from Lauren Hanna”&#x2122;s gun found its trajectory impeded, and any dreams J.F. Jones may have had for the future died with him when a stray bullet lodged in his brain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">Moments after the shooting, Schoonover came running out of the hotel to inform the young men that their carelessness had resulted in a death. Todd stayed put, but cohorts Hanna and <place w:st="on"><city w:st="on">Burton</city></place> slunk down <street w:st="on"><address w:st="on">Second Street</address></street> toward Broadway, emptying their guns of ammunition as they went. Hanna may as well have left a trail of breadcrumbs to the door of his workplace, the Sunset Telephone Company, because that”&#x2122;s where the last of the discarded bullets was found. Detectives Flammer, Quinn, and Churchill quickly located Hanna, who soon confessed to the shooting. He was accused of involuntary manslaughter, and his bail was set at $2000 [$</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial" lang="EN">47,981.55 USD 2008]</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">The cops did some digging into Hanna”&#x2122;s life and uncovered a few unsavory details about him, which were then reported by the Los Angeles Times; “Hanna”&#x2122;s case is not strengthened any, nor public sympathy increased to any great extent, by the discovery of the police that Hanna had recently deserted his wife and baby at Santa Ana, and was living at a hotel in this city with another woman”&#157;.</span></p>

The esteemed senator from <place w:st="on"><state w:st="on">Ohio</state></place> provided money for Lauren”&#x2122;s defense fund. Hanna was represented at trial by Charles S. McKelvey, Esq., and the firm of Davis &amp; Rush.<span>  </span>Experts hired by the defense testified that a bullet fragment removed from Jones”&#x2122; brain at autopsy could have come from a .22 caliber pistol. Hanna”&#x2122;s gun was a .32 caliber. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">Were the Senator”&#x2122;s money and power merely coincidental in winning an acquittal for Lauren? We”&#x2122;ll never know. In any case, Judge Smith felt that there was enough reasonable doubt to instruct the jury to acquit Lauren Hanna.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">J.F. Jones would be buried in his hometown of <place w:st="on"><city w:st="on">Greenville</city>, <state w:st="on">Texas</state></place>.<p></p></span></p>

		<p>There was a place, once, a place people called home–the Hotel Elmar.  Not much of a place, 230 rooms, built in 1926, facing a retaining wall, small matter of a 1953 shotgun holdup you‘ll read about, sure–but you see, it was the <i>people</i> that made the Hotel Elmar what it was.  The Hot L Baltimore of its day.  Of its dope-addled, nudie pinup, shotgun-toting Postwar day.  Let‘s meet some of them now.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3195/2507376342_14b98a0599_o.gif" alt="TheElmar" height="449" width="575"></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3169/2514463314_38edc47dcc_o.gif" alt="lewiscantlose" align="right" height="300" width="157"><b>February 21, 1947</b>.  Our first resident of the Elmar, Ex-Cpl. Roy (Peewee) Lewis, 23, formerly of Joliet, Ill, is one of those war vets who came to Los Angeles.  Los Angeles, the promise of the good life.  You could become anyone.  Your face could be up on the big screen!  Plastered on billboards!  Peewee at least got his plastered all over the corner of <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=James+M+Wood+Blvd+%26+Fedora+St,+Los+Angeles,+CA&amp;sll=34.056802,-118.297606&amp;sspn=0.009031,0.014591&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=34.056802,-118.297606&amp;spn=0.009031,0.014591&amp;t=h&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr" title="lewislosthishead" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ninth and Fedora</a>.</p>
<p>Lewis and his pal Paul Allen, 19, of 647 West 98th Street, were up in San Francisco a while back, where they managed to boost sixteen machine guns from the <a href="http://www.sfarmory.com/history.php" title="armory" target="_blank" rel="noopener">San Francisco</a> <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/01/13/BAG0INI8PD1.DTL" title="kink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Armory</a>.  Back in Los Angeles, they went on a taxi driver-robbing crime spree.  Then they came upon an unusually hard piece of luck.  While motoring along they espied a man who‘d just parked, drove by and gave him the eye a couple more times”¦this tickled the cop-sense of the car‘s occupant, Det. Sgt. Elmer V. Jackson, of administrative vice squad.  He drew his pistol and held it under his coat.</p>
<p>Lewis approached, leveling a paratrooper‘s machine gun at Jackson.  “I‘ll take that”&#157; were Lewis‘ last words, for though he was referring to Jackson‘s wallet, Jackson pushed the door open, knocking the machine gun aside, and Lewis took a service revolver blast to the face.  Allen burned rubber and Jackson emptied his gun at the fleeing car.<br>
<img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3157/2514463350_1c7e918cc6_o.gif" alt="csa" height="93" width="400"><br>
Police found an Elmar Hotel room key on Lewis‘ body and they lit out for Hope Street, just in time to catch Allen leaving with his arms full of clothing.  Allen–whose upper arm was grazed by one of Jackson‘s bullets–said Lewis had persuaded him to commit the holdups after meeting him in a bar, and Allen had agreed since he needed the money to marry a 17 year-old girl. So much for their next planned venture, which was knocking over a store at Slauson and Vermont.<br>
<b><br>
November 14, 1947</b>.   Edna Grover, a raven-haired 20 year-old model, calls the Elmar home.  But it was at the home of photographer William Kemp, 1830 Redesdale Avenue, where investigators from the DA‘s office found over 1,000 lewd photos of Edna.  Kemp was fined $350 ($3,678 current USD) and given a 180-day suspended jail sentence, while our Elmarette was granted probation for her provocative posing.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3119/2513638807_2c58054a79_o.gif" alt="speedspree" align="left" height="175" width="167"><b>March 21, 1952</b>.  Martin Salas, 23, left the Elmar‘s confines for an early morning <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;saddr=S+Main+St+%26+E+5th+St,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90013&amp;daddr=W+6th+St+at+Spring+St,+90013+to:W+3rd+St+%26+S+Spring,+90013+to:W+2nd+St+%26+S+Spring,+Los+Angeles,+Ca+to:W+3rd+St+%26+Figueroa,+Los+Angeles,+CA&amp;mra=pi&amp;mrcr=3&amp;sll=34.047735,-118.249412&amp;sspn=0.009032,0.014591&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=34.051664,-118.250999&amp;spn=0.018063,0.029182&amp;z=15" title="wildride" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spin</a> this day.  At Fifth and Main he hit a truck and injured the driver; he had an argument over right-of-way with a parked car at Sixth and Spring, and another wouldn‘t get out of the way at Third and Spring, and he had a metallic argument with another parked car at Second and Spring.  Undaunted, he piloted smack dab into an RKO movie shoot at Third and Figueroa (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0045205/" title="sf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>Sudden Fear</i></a>?  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0044417/" title="bml" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>Beware, My Lovely</i></a>?) where a motorist that‘d tailed him flagged down a cop.  The officer jerked open Salas‘ door, only to have Salas step on the gas, forcing the cop to run alongside until enough cops tackled the car and forced it to stop.  At some point during Mr. Salas‘ wild ride he‘d had a passenger who ditched in an awful (in every sense of the word) hurry–hair was found on the windshield of the passenger side.  Salas was booked on felony hit-and-run.</p>
<p><b>March 4, 1953</b>.  Jack Hodges is 26, an unemployed aircraft worker, and lives a stone‘s throw from the top of Angels Flight at 314 South Olive.  His pal Dean Coleman, 22, is in school to learn <a href="http://www.smcelectronics.com/tvrep.htm" title="imakemoneyinmysparetime" target="_blank" rel="noopener">television repair</a>, and bunks at the Elmar.  When Coleman isn‘t in school, the two of them visit the local hotels.  With their signature sawed-off shotgun and a briefcase.  The only robbery Coleman didn‘t accompany Hodges on, of course, was the time Hodges robbed the night clerk of the Elmar.  </p>
<p>Coleman‘s money wore thin and he‘d pawned his television repair apparatuses, and went shotgun-brandishing to get the stuff out of hock.  Unfortunately for Coleman, Hodges pawned a stolen wristwatch, which led police to an old mugshot of Hodges; a little police work later and Hodges was caught in a bar at Sixth and Hill, his sawed-off shotgun and briefcase found in his Olive St. hotel room closet.    He gave up Coleman, who was arrested while watching television in the lobby of 235 S. Hope.<br>

Coleman, who studied dramatics before his decision to become a television repair man, was never meant to be a shotgun-wielding, hotel-clerk robbing gunman in real life.  “As you see I don‘t appear to be a tough guy,”&#157; said Coleman, “but I can act the part when the occasion warrants.”&#157;</p>
<p>
<b><br>
July 22, 1956</b>.   Elmar resident Frank Swope, 33, took offense at fellow Bunker Hiller Harold J. McAnally, 57–McAnally lived one block west at 230 South Flower–buying a lady a drink one summer day in a bar at 822 West Third Street.  So Swope walked up and pushed McAnally from his stool, whereupon McAnally landed head-first on the concrete floor.  A few hours after McAnally died from his skull fracture, Swope surrendered to authorities at the Elmar.</p>

February 7, 1957</b>.  LAPD went to investigate a disturbance in a bar at 731 West Third and there arrested “Allan Ayers,”&#157; 32, a resident of the Elmar&#8230;</p>

<p>&#8230;turns out our Elmaree was in reality August Gerbitz, two years on the lam from a double murder rap in Evansville, where in December 1954 he gunned down his girlfriend, Mrs. Nadine Martin, 21, and one George Temme, 38.</p>

March 20, 1957</b>.  Salvador Perez and Jesus Cruz, both 27, had been popped by narco and were up on the fourth floor of Police Administration, having been photographed at the lab.  They were walked into the hallway by officers Hernandez and Ruddell to be cuffed and led to the first-floor Central Jail for booking.</p>
<p>That‘s when both of them made a break for it.  Cruz, of 4923 Gratian Street, was tackled by Ruddell right out of the gate.  Perez, he of 235 South Hope, dashed down the stairway.  Officer Hernandez slipped and fell, broke his ankle, but continued to give chase nevertheless.  Perez ran down to the ground level and made a wrong turn toward Central Jail, turned and ran past Hernandez, but unfortunately, into the arms of Lt. Arroyo.  Another vacancy at the Elmar as Perez (and his buddy Cruz) are booked by an out-of-breath, broken-ankled cop on felony violation of the State Narcotics Act.</p>

Perhaps you too can soak up enough of its magic to place you on this honored roll.</p>
<p>Alas, the City has wiped Hope clean, and thereafter had it thoroughly disinfected, as one would to so much egesta on a cracked tile floor.  They have left us with the most barely readable of palimpsests.  Let‘s take a look.</p>
<p>Hope Street had two levels between Second and Third; here, we are looking north toward Second, standing above the west end of the Third Street tunnel.  The Elmar was midway along the block.</p>

The Ghost Elmar floats roughly above an intersection made by a new street, named after a Lithuanian-Ruthenian <a href="http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~sarmatia/100/thompson.html" title="Kosciuszko" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nobleman-turned-revolutionary</a>.  I betcha Frank Swope or Edna Grover never woulda guessed.</p>
<p>The City doesn&#8217;t screw around when they want something bad enough.  They&#8217;ll move mountains, quite literally, to which these images taken across from the Elmar (looking south down Hope toward the library) attest:</p>

<p>The Elmar, gone, but perhaps now a bit less forgotten.  For this blog is a little like the Elmar itself.  Like it says on the cigarette pack.  Wherever particular people congregate.</p>

<p>On October 16, 1924, <i>Los Angeles Times</i> reporter Charles Sloan took rooms at the Alexandria Hotel under the name of Dr. Chamberlyn Snow, and arranged a meeting with William A. Jackson, President of the National Independent Spiritualist Association, Inc. (NISA).</p>
<p>He wanted to set up practice as a spiritualist and medium in Los Angeles, he told Jackson, but was unable to get a permit under the city&#8217;s ordinances regulating the operation and advertisement of spiritualist practice.  That license would require that &quot;Snow&quot; be ordained by a recognized spiritualist organization, and the problem was, he told Jackson, &quot;I don&#8217;t know a damn thing about spiritualism.&quot;</p>
<p>This was, Jackson said, no problem at all.  All Snow needed to do was to produce a check for $175, and he could be ordained as a spiritualist minister and healer.  Snow gave his money to Jackson&#8217;s wife, Lois A. Jackson, secretary of N.I.S.A., and all was in order.</p>
<p>On November 7, 1924, acting on Sloan&#8217;s information, warrants were issued for the arrest of the Jacksons, the 8 other directors and officers of NISA, and 36 mediums and spiritualists in Los Angeles, on charges of criminal conspiracy, attempts to obtain money by false pretense, larceny by trick and device, and other related charges.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2134/2489029300_f6fa7c4966_m.jpg" alt="lankershim building" align="left" height="240" width="204"> The NISA headquarters were located in the Lankershim Building at 3rd and Spring, and many of those arrested lived right on Bunker Hill.</p>
<p>Besides the Jacksons, who resided at 223 S. Flower Street, were Professor Bernard of 316 1/2 S. Broadway, Mabel Tyler of 318 W. 3rd Street, and Michael Crespo, BS, MS, and PhD, the so-called &quot;miracle man,&quot; who lived at 145 S. Spring.</p>
<p>The bust led to an investigation of over 200 spiritualist groups, 48 of them located in Los Angeles.  The cities of Alhambra and Long Beach set about passing ordinances that would make the practice of spiritualism illegal.</p>
<p>Crespo was the easiest target and first major conviction of the bunch, found in violation of the State Medical Practice Act, and guilty of performing illegal marriages and divorces.</p>
<p>NISA records revealed that the organization boasted a membership of over 235,000 people, and held property valued at $112,000; more importantly, they had ordained approximately 5500 people.  In many cases, they had not followed the organization&#8217;s rules that those ordained would have to &quot;demonstrate the gospel, philosophy, and science of continued existence after so-called death according to some commonly accepted or approved methods of the NISA.&quot;</p>
<p>On February 26, 1925, the Jacksons were found guilty of issuing certificates to unqualified persons, allowing them to circumvent city ordinances regulating the practice of spiritualism.  William was sentenced to 90 days in prison and a $500 fine, and Lois to 30 days in prison and a $250 fine.</p>
<p>City Prosecutor Friedlander said of the proceedings, &quot;If this prosecution&#8230; has done nothing else, it has at least stripped the highly colorful veneer of an organized group of religious imposters who were preying upon a class of credulous, superstitious, and unthinking people and brought to the surface a detailed and elaborate method of fraud.&quot;</p>
<p>When NISA&#8217;s charter was revoked by the state on December 2, 1925, Harry Houdini wired his congratulations to the staff of the Times, saying &quot;It was well done.  You have thrown an obstacle in the path of fraudulent spiritualism which will last for years to come.&quot;</p>

<p>Many of the Bunker Hill mansions went away without much fanfare, their existence blighted by high rises and retained only in the faint memories of former residents. Others, like the Brousseau Mansion, held on long enough to be captured on canvas by the many artists who descended upon the Hill in its final years. The graceful beauty of the Victorian residence shines not only in paintings and photographs but also in the accomplishments of a couple of its most notable residents.</p>

<p>Located on South Bunker Hill Avenue, between Second &amp; Third Street, the house was one of the Hill&#8217;s earliest, built around 1878 by Judge Julius Brousseau. While many early residents of the Hill found themselves tangled up in scandals involving <a href="/node/86" title="Crocker Mansion">kidnapping</a>, <a href="/node/111" title="Brunson Mansion">adultery</a> and <a href="/node/98" title="Rose Mansion">suicide</a>, according to the LA Times, “no citizen of Los Angeles had a better reputation for integrity and good citizenship than Mr. Brousseau.”&#157; The family, including two sons and two daughters resided at the stately mansion until the death of Mrs. Brousseau, around 1901, followed by the Judge in 1903. The Brousseau boys would go on to try their hands at various vocations and daughter Mabel would become a fixture of the City as a respected music teacher. Kate Brousseau, the eldest of the Judge&#8217;s children would prove to be one of Bunker Hill&#8217;s most extraordinary residents.</p>

<p>Kate Brousseau began her teaching career around the age of 20 and was at one time employed as a French instructor at the State Normal School, located where the Central Library now stands.  She also gave French lessons at the family home for 75 cents per visit. In the mid 1890s she began studies at the University of Paris where she was “the only woman student in a Greek class of sixty members.”&#157; Upon her return from France, Kate would frequently translate French literature which was then published in the Los Angeles Times.  She would go on to earn a PhD in psychology, serve with the French Army during WWI and assist the French Army with the rehabilitation of shell shocked soldiers after the war.  Kate publish numerous <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mongolism-physical-characteristics-mongolian-imbeciles/dp/B0006AKA0E/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1210657935&amp;sr=8-1" title="Kate Brousseau at Amazon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">books</a> with subjects including race and education and became an internationally known psychologist, teaching the subject at Mills College from 1907-1928. Although she was born in Michigan and despite her many travels, Kate Brousseau still called Los Angeles home until her death in 1938.</p>

Soon after the Brousseau clan vacated 238 S. Bunker Hill, the residence became a boarding house like so many others on the Hill. A one time showpiece of the neighborhood, by 1939 the twenty-one room house was broken up into 13 units. Of the many occupants who came and went during the mansion&#8217;s half century as multi-housing, the most famous was probably “the funny old man with the birds.”&#157;</p>

<p>When the Community Redevelopment Agency began its scourge of Bunker Hill, many artists and photographers descended upon the neighborhood, desperate to “preserve”&#157; the buildings before they were gone.  Little did these artists know that a resident of 238 S Bunker Hill had been painting scenes of the neighborhood for years. His name was Marcel Cavalla, and by 1963 he had been a resident of the Brousseau Mansion for twenty three years. A retired pastry chef, Cavalla lived alone with his pet birds and painted to “pass the time,”&#157; using the finished products as wallpaper to keep him and the birds company. Before the house was demolished, Cavalla was “discovered”&#157; by a fellow artist and his work received a month long showing at a local art gallery. Suffering from cancer, Cavalla was able to live out his days at the Brousseau residence until his death in 1966. Leo Politi would include a portrait called “Marcel”&#157; in his 1964 tribute Bunker Hill, Los Angeles : reminiscences of bygone days.</p>

By 1967, South Bunker Hill Avenue had been wiped off the map and the Brousseau Mansion along with it. </p>

<p>Mr. A E. and wife had met Herman J. Siemers at the restaurant, where Herman had lunched daily, and they&#8217;d befriended him, she more than he apparently.  Not that Herman‘s offer to Mrs. Stotts of a moonlight horseback ride wasn‘t innocent; unfortunately, it‘s about the only thing in the world more romantic than consumption.  This apparently riled A.

Siemers bounded up the stairs of the Stott‘s Alto Hotel, with all the good health of a man <i>not</i> wasting away from the inside, knocked on the door, and Mrs. Stotts opened.  The two were not aware of the firearm-equipped white-plague addled Mr. Stotts lurking in the dark shadows.<br>

Mr. A. E. lept from the depths and fired one shot into her heart.  He turned on Siemers but elected not to keep to his chest shot MO:  though at very close range, one bullet went through the crown of Siemers‘s hat, another grazed his left temple as it tore through the hat brim, another burned a path across his right temple on taking out the hat brim‘s other side.  A fourth bullet struck Siemers in his right leg.</p>
<p>A. E., having done all he could do and with but one bullet left, dashed to the fire escape, smashed the window pane with his revolver, stepped out on the landing, placed the muzzle to his right temple and fired. </p>

It was bad enough to be saddled with the moniker Stinko Gursasovich ”“ how could things possibly get worse?<span>  </span>On the morning of May 10, 1931, the 42 year old laborer would find out. He was out walking when he suddenly felt hungry. Heading to his room at <street w:st="on"><address w:st="on">215 North Hill Street</address></street> to fix himself a sandwich, he decided that he needed to stop for a snack first. Problem was, there wasn”&#x2122;t a single canned ham or loaf of bread to be had anywhere in the area.<span>  </span>It was then that he decided he”&#x2122;d break into the cellar of a house at 1037 Alpine Street ”“ surely the homeowners would have left some tasty treats in the cellar.

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Date:  July 3, 1904 <br>
Location:  200 Block of Flower Street</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3222/2470089966_42a72475e3_m.jpg" width="240" height="57" align="left" alt="susie1">15-year-old Susie Miller was a pretty brunette with a vivacious disposition who loved to play the violin.  She also loved Willie Miller, a 15-year-old butcher&#8217;s apprentice, and he loved her &#8212; the two were already talking about marriage.  But Susie&#8217;s parents, Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Miller disapproved of the match so strongly that they uprooted the family from their home in San Francisco and moved to Los Angeles in the hopes of squashing the love affair.</p>
<p>The family settled in at a pretty little yellow bungalow on the southwest corner of Flower and Second, and Susie&#8217;s brothers quickly found work &#8212; although the <i>Times</i> was quick to point out that they only took jobs to occupy their time, not because they needed the money.  Samuel Miller was somehow affiliated with the streetcar business in San Francisco and described as &quot;a man in good circumstances.&quot;  Even little Susie got in on the fun, taking a job as an operator at the Home Telephone Company, just down the street.</p>
<p>And then, on the morning of July 3, 1904, Susie Miller disappeared.</p>
<p>She told her mother that she&#8217;d asked to work the 6 a.m. shift at the telephone office in order to have the 4th of July off, and left home at 5:30 that morning.  However, when Susie didn&#8217;t come home for lunch, Mrs. Miller began to worry.  She called the telephone office and was informed that Susie had, in fact, tendered her resignation on June 28, and that there was no 6 a.m. Sunday shift.  The family began to panic, and called police to report her missing.  However, they just as quickly lied and told the police that she&#8217;d returned home, not wanting the story to be reported in the paper.</p>
<p>By July 5, there was still no word from Susie, and they decided to come clean.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2119/2470090000_273e5191cd_m.jpg" width="240" height="142" align="right" alt="susie2"><br>
Yes, there was Willie in San Francisco, but Susie also had another beau in the wings, a man named Harry, last name unknown.  Mrs. Miller said, &quot;Susie met him over the telephone in conversation to begin with and afterwards saw him and told me he was an awfully pretty boy and that she could almost love him.&quot;  All they knew about Harry was that he claimed to be from San Diego, and that his father owned a gold mine.  Their suspicions were heightened when Willie sent a telegram from San Francisco saying he had not seen Susie.</p>
<p>Millie Leach, one of Susie&#8217;s co-workers at the Home Telephone Company, told police that she&#8217;d accompanied Susie to the train station that Sunday morning.  Susie told her she was going to San Diego, but when she purchased her ticket, Millie swore she heard her say, &quot;Frisco.&quot;</p>
<p>So, where was she?  Had she run off with the derelict son of a gold miner, eloped with her hometown sweetheart, or fallen prey to a worse fate?</p>
<p>The <i>Times</i> wrote, &quot;The scheming of a Sherlock Holmes could not have more successfully covered her tracks.&quot;</p>
<p>But where police and reporters alike were stumped, Susie&#8217;s family rose to the occasion and worked to track her down.  Samuel Miller went to San Francisco, and submitted young Willie to some hard questioning, during which the boy cracked.  Susie had gone to a San Francisco hotel owned by her aunt, a woman with whom the family did not keep in touch.  Once she heard her father was on the way, she crossed the bay to stay at the home of another aunt in Vallejo.</p>
<p>After being recovered and returned safely home to Los Angeles, Susie explained herself saying that she meant to write home, but after taking off, it seemed like &quot;a good joke&quot; to let her family wonder where she was.  Then, once the police got involved, she was too scared to tell them where she was.  Outsmarting the LAPD is one thing, but dear old dad is quite another.</p>
