<p>As Bunker Hill developed from a fashionable Victorian neighborhood to an area of somewhat slummy dwellings, the grand mansions of the earlier era adapted with the times. In most cases, the large homes were converted into multi resident housing, sometimes a mere decade or two after construction. However, there are rare cases of Bunker Hill homes being inhabited by one family from the beginning to the bitter end, as was the case with the Larronde home at 237 North Hope Street. <br>
<!--break--><br>
At one time, the name Larronde was a fairly well known one in the City of Angels. Pierre Larronde was a native Frenchman who landed in San Francisco in 1847 and made a killing in the gold mines. When he relocated to Los Angeles in 1851, he amassed a further fortune by successfully raising sheep on one of the Ranchos. Always the astute businessman, Larronde cashed out his sheep empire in the late 1880s and focused his energies on real estate. His holdings included prime land at the corner of First and Spring, and a parcel on North Hope Street near Temple where he built the family home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</div>
<p>Pierre Larronde had a great deal in common with a fellow Los Angeles pioneer named Jean Etchemendy. Both men hailed from a south western region in France called the Basses-Pyrenees, both briefly lived in South America before cashing in early on the Gold Rush, and both successfully settled in Los Angles as sheep ranchers. Last but not least, both men married a gal named Juana Egurrola. Juana was born in Marquina, Spain but moved to California with her family at a very young age. She married Etchemendy in 1865 and gave birth to daughters Mariana, Madeleine and Carolina. Jean Etchemendy died in 1872 and Juana mourned for a couple of years before hooking up with the other French sheep-man in town. Juana’s 1874 union with Pierre Larronde produced three children, Pedro Domingo, John and Antoinette.</p>

Larronde House on 1888 &amp; 1950 Sanborn Map
</div>
<p>
The Sanborn Fire Insurance maps show the house on Hope Street as being under construction in 1888. The Larronde Bunch moved in shortly thereafter and held gatherings on a regular basis that made the society pages. Unlike many residences of Bunker Hill, the Larronde home suffered no scandals or controversies. Pierre the pioneer died in 1896, around the age of 70, and Juana resided on Hope Street until her death in 1920 at the ripe old age of 84.</p>

</div>
<p>Of the six Larronde/Etchemendy children, only two ventured off of Hope Street. Pedro Domingo would become a principal in the Franco American Baking Company and Antoinette married James J. Watson and had three children. John served as the head of the Fire Commission for a number of years and lived at 237 N. Hope Street until his death in 1954. The three Etchemendy girls also lived in the mansion for decades. Madeleine died shortly after her stepbrother in 1954, and Caroline and Mariana would live on for another decade. </p>
<p>For nearly eighty years, one family resided in the house at 237 North Hope Street. By the <br>
end of the 1960s, all traces of the Larronde/Etchemendy clan were erased from Bunker Hill.</p>

<p>
Louis Burgess Greenslade, a native of Devon, England and better known as Lewis, The Light, was already balmy in January 1889, when Doctors Field and Fitch of Bellevue Hospital sent him to the Hart Island asylum, off Manhattan.</p>
<p>He had been institutionalized after his neglected wife came from Pasadena in response to a letter from Louis stating that one of their sons, who was traveling with him, was dying. She sold everything she had to finance the trip, where she discovered her child was quite well, but Louis —not so much.</p>
<p>Some time later Louis left the asylum to rejoin his family in California, where he found his wife had died after telling neighbors she was a widow, and that his children had been put into public care. He moved to downtown Los Angeles, where he grew a long beard, dressed &quot;in fantastic garb,&quot; declared himself a messiah and lived on the donations of true believers. </p>
<p>An investigation resulted in him being declared unfit to rear his daughter Calla Lily (aged 14 in 1891), and he went to court seeking her release, then tried to snatch her from Mrs. Watson&#8217;s Home. He was tried on grounds of insanity, but freed because the thrifty law required homicidal or suicidal tendencies if a madman was to be cared for in an asylum. He tried to make a speech to the court, was rebuffed, and in January 1892 was determined to be in fact dangerous and committed to the State Insane Asylum at Agnews (a village later absorbed by Santa Clara). </p>
<p>But by June he was reported to be handing out peculiar circulars outside Metropolitan Hall in San Francisco, and in October arrested in that city on a charge of having torched the Turnverein Hall. In April 1894 he was sent back to the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/history/nr/travel/santaclara/agn.htm" target="_blank">asylum at Agnews</a>, a place he claimed was ideal for &quot;resting and fattening up.&quot; (Lucky Lewis was not at the trough in April 1906, when the institution collapsed in the great earthquake, killing 117 patients and staff. All were buried on the grounds, which now comprise the supposedly haunted Sun Microsystems campus.)</p>
<p><img src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3295/2730434552_63c5ceb9b8_o.jpg"></p>
<p>Satisfied with his care and the width of his belly, Lewis escaped and returned to San Francisco, where he was arrested after ripping open his clothing and asking passersby to witness the divine light that burned in his breast.</p>
<p>For the rest of 1894, through 1895, 1896 and 1897 there was no sign of Lewis the Light. But in January 1898 he made a triumphant return to Los Angeles, tossing down a hand-written message at the feet of the deaf-mute newsstand operator Max Cohn at 124 ½ South Spring Street.</p>
<p>&quot;Max: Read this intelligently and with interest! Deaf mutes are caused by the unnatural crime of rebelling against Lewis the Light! All nature, together with humanity, groans for lack of using Lewis the Light! Whilst people are such unnatural fools as to breed mules, there will also be deaf mutes to suffer for it. Greater than the ram&#8217;s horn is the horn of the he-goat.&quot; LEWIS THE LIGHT</p>
<p>He was at this time living atÂ  230 South Olive Street with two of his sons who worked as messengers and supported the family. By July 1898, the L.A. Times already sounded sick of him when reporting &quot;Los Angeles is again afflicted with [his] prophecies.&quot;</p>
<p>Lewis the Light, you see, what a newspaper reader and a letter writer. He&#8217;d comb the papers for reports of some personal catastrophe, then send a note (or many notes) preaching doom and damnation to the unfortunate sufferer, with the promise that future traumas could be avoided if they could only consult him, and tithe accordingly. (That fire in San Francisco was just another subject that drew his interest, but only after the fact.) Hence in July &#8217;98, E.T. Earl had to contend not only with the loss of his Wilshire boulevard home to fire, but with an original missive from Lewis, The Light:</p>
<p>&quot;Armageddon, allegorically and literally. Now Earl: count yourself as having been subjected to one variety, at least of Fire, and liable to many others through utterly failing to do your duty in personally and practically recognizing and rendering his due to the Lord of Life. Deut. 3-15, 32-22.&quot; </p>
<p>The message was signed with a rubber stamp showing a horse and an invitation to visit &quot;Lewis, the Light, accident preventer&quot; at this address. Mr. Earl called the cops, and Louis was warned to knock off with the nasty notes (particularly the letters to women, which were especially racy) or he&#8217;d be shipped back to the bug house. A record was made of his business card, which read, &quot;Accident preventer, central civilizer, longevity promoter; subject to nothing; terms a tithe.&quot;</p>
<p>In May 1899, one of Louis&#8217; sons, his 22-year-old namesake, flipped out after reading too deeply in the scientific section of the public library. The young man, who fancied himself an inventor, went into the basement offices of his employers, the California District messenger service beneath the Los Angeles National Bank and began smashing windows, furnishings and bicycles. He was subdued and taken to the County Hospital, where he raved he had &quot;been doped.&quot; Facing the judge, young Louis frothed maniacally and tore at his chains while the father calmly answered questions about his son&#8217;s mental state. The boy was committed to the Highland asylum after becoming so unruly he had to be removed from the courtroom.</p>
<p>On March 2, 1901, at 2pm, there was a conflict in Central Park (now Pershing Square), when Lewis the Light&#8217;s prediction of the second coming of Christ was scheduled for the same hour as a concert by the Catalina Marine Band. This disrespect so incensed Lewis that J.M. Garrison, the park foreman, called for police protection at the holy hour. According to a petition then circulating (with 800 signatures to date), the park had become something of an eyesore due to the &quot;[infestation of] loafers an bums to such an extent that its usefulness to the populace as an airing-place is destroyed.&quot;</p>
<p>The petition read: &quot;We, the undersigned, residents of Los Angeles, respectfully petition that legal means be employed to abate the public nuisance of the large gathering of men and boys daily in the band stand at Central Park. We are persuaded that the public haranguing at the park destroys the attractiveness of the place, interferes with the rights of the public, and exercises an immoral influence, especially upon the young boys, whose minds are constantly filled with false views of nature and of life. Much of the talk at the band stand we believe to be blasphemous, although a few conscientious men do endeavor daily to antidote this poison, we believe their efforts are in the main futile, and we believe its abatement a great necessity.&quot; It was filed in city council, alongside a contrasting petition presented by John Murray, Junior of the Socialist Democratic Party, in support of free speech. And of course, Lewis the Light had an opinion about the matter.</p>
<p><img src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3122/2729566411_b5a2f5b486_o.png"></p>
<p>As could be expected, the September 1901 assassination of President William McKinley drew the attention of Lewis the Light (then age 49), and after he penned some of his typical missives (signed &quot;Umbilical Cord of the Universe, Potentate of Prosperity&quot;) convinced the Eastern recipients that he was a dangerous anarchist. Local detectives knew him as a harmless crank, but nonetheless took him into custody as a courtesy to their colleagues in the east. Arrested at his Olive Street abode, Louis snapped &quot;You can&#8217;t do me any harm, for I am Jesus Christ.&quot; In court he proclaimed his opposition to anarchy, and claimed he was the only person to speak out against Red Emma Goldman during her visit to Los Angeles. Unimpressed, Judge Shaw proclaimed him insane</p>
<p>In 1907, Lewis the Light crossed paths with author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who inquired with Los Angeles police about some mysterious letters sent in his care to <a href="https://www.siracd.com/life_case1.shtml" target="_blank">George Edalji</a>, whose conviction false on charges of animal cruelty Doyle helped eradicate via a most <a href="https://www.historynet.com/sir-arthur-conan-doyle-the-case-of-george-edalji.htm" target="_blank">Holmesian investigation</a>. The Edalji family&#8217;s troubles had begun with anonymous letters, but local police were able to soothe their concerns when they assured Doyle that neither their local crank nor his recent roommate Frank Sharp had anything but an idle interest in their affairs. One side effect of Doyle&#8217;s interest was the discovery that Louis Greenslade had left England after annoying a Sir Henry Knight with weird letters.</p>
<p>In 1908, Lewis the Light was charged with vagrancy and sentenced to thirty days after annoying citizens who he threatened should they refuse to pay a tithe. This would be the last appearance of this colorful character in the pages of the L.A. Times, and before long, his name, once an object of glee and fascination, sank into obscurity.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>On May 27, 1947, Proposition B, a $12 million bond issue passed, allowing the city to sink some serious dough into its woefully inadequate parks, playgrounds, and municipal pools.  One of the first neighborhoods slated to get a new playground and community recreation center was Bunker Hill, with a site at the corner of 2nd and Hope, just over half an acre, selected and purchased by the City.  After a November 14, 1949 groundbreaking, the $121,646 modern recreation facility was dedicated on August 21, 1950.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3287/2672527676_f27bfb98b1.jpg" width="500" height="403" alt="bunkerhillplayground"></p>
<p>In addition to grounds with a wading pool, basketball courts, and playground equipment, the nearly 9000-square foot recreation hall featured a stage for movie screenings and theatrical productions, classrooms, a kitchen, showers, and handball courts (on the roof, no less).  Sure, it&#8217;s a little institutional-looking, and sure, it could do with a little less concrete, some foliage that doesn&#8217;t look so spindly and diseased, and maybe some wood chips under the monkey bars to protect tender young heads, but still, it&#8217;s a pretty spiffing playground.</p>
<p>And a long time coming, too.  Residents of Bunker Hill had been clamoring for a neighborhood recreation area for over 25 years, lamenting the fact that children in the neighborhood lived in cramped quarters and had no place to play safely.  A playground, residents said, would help alleviate the truancy, delinquency, and other youth problems in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>But the thing was, until 1923, Bunker Hill had a very fine recreation area for children&#8230; until the City tore it down to make way for the new Central Library.</p>
<p>After the Normal Hill School area was razed, Mrs. Harry White wrote to the City Council, pleading for a playground for the neighborhood&#8217;s children:</p>
<p>&quot;They are not permitted to play in the streets, and as most of them live in rented houses without grounds there is no provision for any sort of recreation, or for the care of these children.  Many of the parents are working people and the children are alone all day.&quot;</p>
<p>In the 25 years without a recreation area, kind-hearted Bunker Hill residents did their best to fill in the gaps.  Mr. and Mrs. Herbert Abbott of 220 S. Bunker Hill Avenue organized beach outings, holiday parties and free movies for hundreds of children in the neighborhood, while Mrs. Pearl Alcantara founded the Children&#8217;s Community Garden in a vacant lot at California and Grand, after her son was killed by a car while playing in the street.   About 50 boys and girls helped her to clear the lot of trash and rocks (although some adult neighbors who weren&#8217;t keen on the idea would scatter more trash and rocks at night).</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3162/2672694414_06828c9d21_o.jpg" width="226" height="156" align="left" alt="playgroundsold">During the 12 years that the Bunker Hill Playground served the neighborhood, its facilities were tremendously popular, and its programs well-attended.  However, it wouldn&#8217;t last long.  In 1962, the Department of Parks and Recreation recommended sale of the playground and recreation center to the CRA for $325,000.  Within a year, the City Council would approve the sale, cash the check, and soon, the playground was just another Bunker Hill ghost.</p>

		<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2254/2660612112_3f255d818e_o.gif" alt="Marcella" height="592" width="575">Today we discuss The Marcella, who once flaunted her classical order on Flower (she is Italian, please be advised the C in her name is not pronounced <i>s</i> as in <i>sell</i>, but like <i>ch</i> as in <i>chin</i>).  See how her name beckons, proud but not haughty, from her entablature?  She wants to take you in and protect you under that great cornice with her large corbels.  Despite her imposing presence, she is warm, and welcoming; the wide porches bespeak grace, and the timberframe vernacular on the bays coo <i>cozy by the fire lad, there’s good feelings in mortise and tenon</i>.  </p>
<p>But don’t speak of  fire.  Fire struck the Marcella in October of 1912, sending well-to-do ladies like Mrs. L. M. Harvey to Pacific Hospital after having leapt from upper stories.  Other occupants hustled (stricken with panic; see below) and scantily attired into the street.  Marcella owner C. F. Holland states he’s looking at $3,000 ($65,983 USD2007) in damages, $2,000 to the rugs and furniture alone.  <br>
<img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3236/2660611730_dcbcdcb8cb_o.gif" alt="PanicStricken" height="141" width="526"><br>
It is reported that a man was seen running from the building a few minutes before the fire broke out.  The storeroom, where the fire began, was not locked.  The mystery is never solved but Marcella, stout of bay and stalwart of column, cannot be burned away.  She perseveres.<br>
<img loading="lazy" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2001/2660612342_da8059f7d9_o.gif" alt="Cometomother" height="820" width="575"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Marcella is a building so lovely she attracts only the comeliest of patrons.  She is home to Miss May Long, a lass so fetching that when in May of 1913 she turned her attentions to one Earl G. Horton, he is gunned down by another suitor outside of his apartment house near <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=1129+W+Temple+St,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90012&amp;sll=34.068214,-118.251193&amp;sspn=0.00855,0.013304&amp;layer=c&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=34.067841,-118.251235&amp;spn=0.00855,0.013304&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr&amp;cbll=34.063953,-118.25192&amp;panoid=GHaKiWGCNCAnGNrIWbCV1Q" title="shooting" target="_blank">Temple &amp; Victor</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jealousy over a woman causes upset <i>again</i> at the Marcella on October 25 of 1922 when Emergency Patrolman Claude Coffrin went to visit Mrs. Tillie Smith in her Marcella apartment.  Not long after Coffrin&#8217;s ingress, there appeared Emergency Patrolman Anthony Kazokas and a civilian, Joe Cummins.  Kazokas had loaned Cummins his revolver and badge to settle his romantic score with Coffrin over Tillie.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3222/2661876479_09a095e2ae_o.gif" alt="nothingbuttroubleItellya" height="117" width="488"></p>
<p>Coffrin and Cummins fought, and Coffrin gained control of the gun; he phoned the Detective Bureau and over came officers Nickens and Ellis.  Cummins at that point grabbed the gun back from Coffrin and stuck it in Nickens’ side, and Patrolman Kazokas jumped on Detective Ellis.  Ellis brained Kazokas out cold with the butt of his gun, but Nickens ended up shooting Cummins through the neck.  </p>
<p>The lovely Mrs. Smith was arrested on violation of parole; she had been sentenced on the 18th to pay $50 and spend thirty days in jail—suspended—for “social vagrancy”&#157;.  Apparently, quality of young lady was beginning to decline at the Marcella.<br>
<img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3207/2659783783_d34bd5730f_o.jpg" alt="marcellaad" height="39" width="267"><br>
Other upstanding members of society to grace the Marcella’s rooms were the Jacksons, of whom you read all about <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/node/118" title="NISA" target="_blank">here</a>. <br>
<img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3192/2661937757_978aa42f59_o.gif" alt="TheJackson2" height="335" width="459"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And remember <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/iwantolive" title="idont" target="_blank">Barbara Graham</a>?  What helped send Barbara to the chair was hubby Henry’s testimony on the witness stand.  Her last-ditch alibi was that she and Henry were together that night of March 9, 1953—but Henry testified he had already moved out and was living with his mother…at the Marcella.  (A mere two blocks down from the Lancaster, scene of Baxter Shorter&#8217;s abduction.)</p>
<p>Little Tommy Graham, now five, was living in the Marcella in 1957 when Wanger Pictures gave him $1000 for filming his executed mother’s life story.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fire again struck the Marcella, this time in 1962, and this time it meant business.  On March 30 a blaze razed the upper two stories of the structure.  Twelve fire units quelled the blaze in half an hour; She of 223 South Flower vanished from memory soon afterward.</p>
<p>Here we are looking north on Flower through the intersection of Third, 1965.  See the little Victorian, left center?  The Marcella was just on the other side of that.<br>
<img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3091/2660612482_6fe71a9943_o.gif" alt="UpFlower" height="410" width="575"><br>
Today Flower Street makes a sharp turn between Third and Second to avoid the Bunker Hill Towers.  The Marcella stood just on the other side of this pool:</p>

<p>Interesting, and, what, perhaps a little unnerving, but certainly instructive, to consider that the image that began this post, and the one immediately above, were taken from the same spot.</p>

		<p>February 28, 1954<br>
205 South Figueroa</p>
<p>James Saul Pauge, a 60-year-old newspaper vendor and retired railroad conductor, was murdered in his apartment today under exceptionally puzzling circumstances.Â  Help couldn&#8217;t have arrived any sooner, but it was still too late.</p>
<p>Pauge&#8217;s neighbor Louis Jaralillo, a former boxer, heard a shot fired and ran upstairs to Pauge&#8217;s apartment to investigate.Â  Pauge stood in front of his open front door, swaying and gesturing towards his back, unable to speak.Â  Almost immediately, he fell over dead of a gunshot wound.Â  The can of soup Pauge was preparing for his dinner was still simmering on the stove.</p>
<p>The window in Pauge&#8217;s apartment overlooked 2nd Street, and had been left open.Â  Police suspected that a sniper had fired in through the window, and hit Pauge in the back as he stood at the stove.Â  No motive could be established for the killing, and no suspects were apprehended.</p>

<p>…so now it’s time to sew things up, recounting a collection of other Dome-flavored contretemps:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3188/2639344771_89d3266cbc_o.gif" alt="CookFight" align="left" height="172" width="227"><b><br>
April 7, 1940</b>.  Mike Scaiola, 29, and Rocco Spagnuolo, 35, both cooks, were roomies at the Dome. Over what they argued in their Domeroom is lost to time; all that’s known is what Scaiola later told the cops—during a scuffle he saw the .32 automatic protruding from Spagnuolo’s shirt and attempted to wrest it from him.  Oldest story in the world:  accidental discharge, someone takes one in the chest, and Spagnuolo’s DOA at Georgia Street Receiving.  </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3032/2640171664_4b3a38e1ba_o.gif" alt="jackiejailed" align="right" height="180" width="216"><b><br>
September 18, 1941</b>.  Mrs. Cleo (Jackie) Wooten, 19, was a plucky gal, but take this as a warning:  having pluck in spades gets the FBI involved.  Cleo was visiting friends in Cunningham, Kan. for some time and was there driving the car owned by Eddie Palzo of that city.  He had no objection to her driving the car around Cunningham, but swore out a felony complaint when the Dome resident decided to Dome home.  She was picked up at Third and Figueroa when an officer noticed the license on his stolen car list. </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3058/2639476665_d10268e4e7_o.gif" alt="JoeSlasher" align="left" height="199" width="217"><b><br>
July 4, 1942</b>.  The character of Dome resident Joe Barron, 28, cook (another cook?  Too many cooks really do spoil the pot), did not reflect well on the Dome’s nobility.  He was strolling down Fifth Street and passed between one William O. Smith, 37, and Smith’s 21 year-old wife Dorothy when he elected to make an off-color remark to the wife.  That didn’t go over well with Mr. Smith, a recent transplant from Arkansas, who slashed Barron’s throat, severing an artery.  Luckily, Dorothy instructed William to press his thumb on the artery to stanch the flow of blood, and they hauled Barron into a room at 107 E. Fifth until medical aid could be summoned.  Barron survived, we trust, wiser and more gentelmanly.</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3095/2639344229_08665c444d_o.gif" alt="LeonasPurse" align="right" height="102" width="172"><b><br>
December 21, 1942</b>.  Mrs. Leona Smith was followed home from a café last November 7, only to have her purse snatched—a purse containing $1600 in cash and checks and $4800 worth of jewelry ($6400=$89,216 USD2007).  After a month of searching by cops based on Leona’s description of the man and his car, they finally popped Clifford Allen Payne, 32, at the Dome.  He took them to the 3500 block of Helms in Culver where he dug up a glass jar containing the checks and jewelry.  The real mystery is what she was doing with that sort of booty in her purse.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3259/2640171574_f87b21c32f_o.gif" alt="afbarshoot" align="left" height="62" width="204"><b>March 11, 1961</b>.  Alfred Carrillo, 33, was a Dome resident in good standing who had the bad luck to be sitting in a bar at 301 South Hill Street one early Friday morning.  Victor F. Jimenez, 26, unemployed truck driver, shot Alfred and then drove off, later to be arrested at his home.  (The bar at 301 South Hill, by the way, was the bar at the base of Angels Flight—seen here with Lon Chaney Jr. in the 1956 outing <a href="https://www.archive.org/details/indestructible_man" title="IM" target="_blank"><i>Indestructible Man</i></a>🙂</p>

<p>
That’s what we have for now.  Can’t promise it’s the last of it, as tales and details may still bubble up from the cracked core of time.  What about you?  Remember your great aunt Nell?  The one you socked away at Shady Pines?  (The rest home, not the cemetery.)   She may harbor descriptions of devious Dome debauchery from back in the day.  Go find out before you have to shift Shady Pines.</p>

July 16, 1895</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial"><br>
</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial"><img loading="lazy" border="0" width="286" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3022/2633584927_6af00361e8_o.jpg" alt="Bertha headline" height="97"><br>
Miss Bertha Fisher, aged 14, had looked forward to dressing in the latest fashions and attending parties with her friends. Unfortunately for Bertha, her parents had other plans for her future. As strict Salvationists, they thought that she was old enough to don a Salvation Army uniform (which was definitely not Bertha’s notion of a fashion forward frock) and begin trolling the streets of <city w:st="on"><place w:st="on">Los Angeles</place></city> for souls in peril. Bertha preferred saving dance cards, party invitations, and lovely corsages to saving souls, so she ran away with a young man named Mr. White.<!--break--></span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial"> </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial"></span></p>
<p>Frantic over Bertha’s escapade, the distraught Fishers spent hours haunting the local police station hoping for news of their wayward daughter. Police were on the lookout for the reluctant missionary, but Mrs. Fisher became antsy and enlisted the aid of another Salvationist to help her comb the city for the missing girl.<p></p> <br>
<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial"><br>
After Bertha had been gone for nearly two days, Mrs. Fisher and her fellow soldier in God’s army got a tip.<span>Â  </span>The two dashed to the cop shop where they breathlessly announced to the assembled officers that they “knew where she was at”&#157;.<span>Â  </span>The women had found out that Bertha and Mr. White were occupying room 28 at the Melrose Hotel, and asked Officer Richardson to accompany them to the suspected love nest.<p></p></span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial"><p>Â </p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial">The landlady at the Melrose Hotel told Officer Richardson that the young man had engaged a room for his sister, and because she’d had no reason to doubt his veracity, she’d rented it to him. <span>Â </span>Mrs. Fisher was doubtless relieved when the landlady went on to say that even though White had rented a room for Bertha, he had never shared it with her.</span> <img loading="lazy" border="0" width="500" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3137/2633778861_0cfddae700.jpg" alt="Hotel Melrose" height="366"></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial">To avoid arrest Bertha reluctantly went home with her mother, but it’s unlikely that their difference of opinion was settled that day. Bertha was heard to remark, “I’d rather go to the Reform School than stay at home if I have to become a Salvation Army lassie”&#157;.</span></p>

240 South Figueroa</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3277/2629592339_e607658060.jpg" alt="hiddenhooch" align="left" height="251" width="238">Police came to the apartment of William Fisher and Walter J. O&#8217;Connell, responding to neighbors&#8217; complaints of a loud party.  When they arrived, they found seven men and a woman seated  primly around a large round table, and grinning like mad.  However, police could not help but notice &quot;the odor of synthetic gin was in the air.&quot;</p>
<p>At first, police were stumped.  There was no evidence of a party, and no bottles to be seen.  But then, one of the detectives noticed a stream of liquid trickling out from the thick center leg of the table, and a sniff revealed it to be contraband booze.</p>
<p>Quickly, the detectives dismantled the table and discovered that its leg had been hollowed out, and a hooch tank and spigot installed.  In all the excitement, some careless partygoer had neglected to twist the spigot shut, leading to the telltale leak.</p>
<p>A more thorough search of the apartment turned up two copper tanks, designed to be fitted into an automobile gas tank and used for the illicit transport of bathtub gin.  Fisher and O&#8217;Connell were booked on charges of violating the Volstead Act.</p>

		<p>Here was the Van Fleet, a three-story frame apartment house built in 1911 by Garrett &amp; Bixby for citrus man Nelson Van Fleet. The 29 apartments were split between two- and three-room models, and it was in one of them on March 22, 1912, that Marie Higginson, 40-ish &quot;and quite prepossessing,&quot; having failed to shoot herself in San Pedro last week, gassed herself in the kitchen. Her groans alerted Mrs. Francis Passmore across the hall. Found unconscious on a blanket on the kitchen floor with the oven door removed,Â  Marie&#8217;s purse revealed the gun and a copy of Walter Malone&#8217;s poem <a href="https://www.poetry-archive.com/m/opportunity.html" target="_blank">&quot;Opportunity&quot;</a>—a popular verse among self annihilators, for Joseph N. Vincent recently blew his brains out on Silverwood Hill with the last stanzas in his pocket.</p>
<p>Marie, though, did not die, and on awakening, confessed that in San Pedro her hand had shaken so that she had missed her mark. &quot;I didn&#8217;t shoot a second time because I feared I might not hit a vital spot and would die a lingering death.&quot; The cause of it all was her unhappiness with the mining man who was her companion, so she was trying to remove herself from the equation while he was away in Maricopa. Her miner returned to news that Marie was going before the lunacy commission, but we do not know how she fared there.</p>
<p>An L.A. Times article surveying the freakishly high cost of rents (up as much as 400% in four years) and the difficulty in finding a place that would accept children noted that a two-room apartment with a bath and kitchenette at the Van Fleet would set you back $75 a month in October 1920.</p>
<p>On New Years Eve 1932, 28-year-old entertainer Matthew Tormino left his apartment at the Van Fleet for a booking at the Verdugo Trout Club Lodge in Verdugo Hills. At some point while Tormino, James W. Curtis and Inez Stewart were amusing the guests, a large man became incensed and the talent made a dash for the door. Tormino was the last one out, and took a bullet to the hip. When questioned by police, all anyone could say was that the shooter was &quot;a big guy.&quot; Tormino was expected to recover, but we suggest he work on his act.</p>

Above photo borrowed from the <a href="https://www.csulb.edu/~odinthor/socal8.html" target="_blank">&quot;A Visit to Old Los Angeles&quot;</a> website</p>
<p>January 13, 1913 was opening day for the Northern Hotel, a fireproof, 10-story establishment of 200 rooms with baths, built by F.W. Braun (wealthy president of the Braun corporation, dealers in assay and chemical lab equipment) and designed by his favorite architect W.J. Saunders. </p>
<p>It stood on the site of the old 3-story Carling Hotel, which the thrifty Mr. Braun ordered moved to the rear of a lot on the west side of Flower Street, just south of Court Street; Saunders was also reported working on a 3-story addition to the front of the old building to give it a modern face onto Flower.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3257/2566961122_def018ed10_o.png"></p>
<p>During the early days of the year long construction (estimated cost $100,000), the Northern was reported to have been leased for a period of ten years for a rental of $200,000. This prompted one L.A. Times reporter to muse &quot;the project is of especial interest as showing the sterling value of downtown frontage north of Fourth Street, revealing as it does the confidence of a leading capitalist in this older section of the city.&quot; </p>
<p>But things change quickly, even on old Bunker Hill, and by opening day leasee James Kincheloe was nowhere to be seen, with management undertaken by Frank L. and Blanche L. Crampton. The Cramptons were 20 year hoteliers, formerly of Seattle and Alaska. They most recently managed the Seminole Hotel on Flower Street. Sadly, their time at the Northern rang the final bell for their concord, for on Hallowe&#8217;en Eve 1916, Blanche peered through a transom and spotted Frank in the arms of another&#8230; a lady dentist! (Maybe she was just checking his bridge.) Blanche sued for divorce, noting that she had for some time been engaging detectives to follow Frank, but that she&#8217;d finally solved the case herself. After obtaining suitable visual evidence for the divorce, spry Blanche broke out the glass in the transom and climbed down into the dentist&#8217;s room, ordered her to put on her street clothes and marched the homewrecker right out of the hotel.</p>
<p>
Conveniently located at the intersection of Second and Clay, the Northern was a reinforced concrete structure curiously designed with Bunker Hill&#8217;s eventual demise in mind. Its foundations, you see, ran thirty feet down, to permit the addition of two extra floors of rooms should the hill ever be shaved away. Other innovations included running ice water in every room, a central vacuum system, steam heat, hydraulic elevators for passengers and freight, telephones, and a French parlor for the ladies on the fifth floor. </p>
<p>Entrance to the hotel was made though the Second Street lobby, a fantasia in Italian marble, bronze, mahogany and tilework. The Mission furnishings were of red leather. From Clay Street, one could reach the dining room and grill, also fitted out in the Mission style, as well as the laundry and work rooms. </p>
<p>The Northern was not a year old when it found its first unquiet spirit. Anna, wife of Butte, Montana capitalist Jacob Osenbrook, came to Los Angeles with her husband and son Arthur to spend Christmas in the city. She had been suffering depression for several months, and it was hoped a change of scene and altitude would ease her worries. The family had just checked into their suite, and Jacob and Anna were standing at the sixth floor window, amusing themselves by comparing the number of passing motorcars to horses. Anna was a horse fan, and exclaimed loudly whenever one entered the scene. In the midst of the conversation, Jacob went to the next room to get a glass of water. When he returned, the curtains were outside the window&#8230; and when he looked outside, he saw that Anna had joined the horses below.</p>
<p>By May 1919, the Northern was under new ownership, having passed from the Union Realty Company to the Los Angeles and Santa Monica Beach Company. A news report curiously describes the building as a 9-story structure, but they may not have been counting the service basements.</p>

<p>In July 1920 a bizarre incident unfolded at the Northern, when two little girls from Little Rock &#8212; Laura Cash and Margaret Martin – arrived in Los Angeles and encountered a strange, ticked off lady who tossed a note addressed to Miss Martin into the room she shared with Miss Cash. It read: &quot;Margaret Martin, it will not pay you to keep on with Levee. A word to the wise is sufficient. Mrs. Levee.&quot;</p>
<p><img src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3128/2594688575_50012f94ef.jpg"><br>
Above, Matilda Levee in repose</p>
<p>Baffled by this message, Miss Martin went off to take a stroll. It was then that Matilda, long estranged wife of attorney Frederick R. Levee, entered the Hotel Northern and returned to the room where she&#8217;d left the note, encountering there Miss Cash. Assuming Cash was Martin, as she had previously assumed Martin was messing with her hubby (later it was asserted that Martin&#8217;s visiting card was on Levee&#8217;s desk because his law partner knew her), Mrs. Levee brandished a cowhide whip and slashed Miss Clark five or six times across the face. Cash shrieked, of course, and her assailant fled. Where&#8217;s <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/bellanapoli">Eugene Corey</a> when you need him?</p>
<p><img src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3123/2595524162_0fdc105736.jpg"><br>
Above, Matilda Levee in action</p>
<p>Mrs. Levee, formerly of 1001 South Union Avenue, was at the time suing her husband for divorce and maintenance, and had previously whipped at least two other women who she believed to be involved with Frederick, who had long since abandoned her. Previous victims include Mrs. Emma K. Doyle of Chicago, whipped at the Hotel Clark in December 1918, and Mrs. Inez M. Farnham, a cabaret singer from the Philippines, whipped in a hotel dining room and chased down Broadway while Frederick watched. Police quickly located Matilda in Santa Monica and held her pending civil charges which went unfiled, as the Arkansans had suffered sufficient embarrassment. (Inez never sued either.) Matilda was, however, brought up before the Lunacy Commission at the behest of Frederick, found to be &quot;not absolutely normal, but not insane&quot; (this is the new slogan of On Bunker Hill), and freed.</p>
<p>Frederick Levee meanwhile checked the wind and fled the state, abandoning his car in El Paso and continuing east by rail. He was arrested in New Orleans by agents of the Nick Harris detective agency in March 1921 and was to be returned to Los Angeles to face judge Walton J. Wood, who had just ruled in Matilda&#8217;s favor on their divorce and the $200 monthly alimony she sought, and who was not amused that Frederick had missed the court date. At this hearing, Matilda testified that they had failed to live happily as husband and wife, and that she had finally told him to &quot;hit the ties and keep going&quot; or she would &quot;get&quot; him. Previously, Frederick had protested &quot;Why, she even shot a hole through my coat&quot; to which the sassy Matilda snapped &quot;Well, didn&#8217;t I buy you the coat?!&quot; She&#8217;d also once visited him in his law office and shot him in the arm.  </p>
<p>Somehow&#8211;maybe he told them what his home life was like?&#8211;Frederick gave the detectives the slip. By late April, the Levees were both in New Orleans, Matilda seeking to hasten Frederick&#8217;s extradition. On arrival, she discovered that he had established a law office in the Maison Blanche Building in Canal Street, and had obtained one of those sneaky Louisiana divorces without her knowledge. She fumed and stalked him.</p>
<p>Finally on May 7 she lurked near the St. Charles Hotel until he came out and saw her. They spoke briefly, and as he turned away she&#8230; what, do you think, whipped the heck out of him? Oh no, whips are for women. Husbands get the gun. Before hundreds of witnesses Matilda shot Frederick in the back, causing his death. Clapped in jail yelling that she had done it to save other women the pain she had suffered, Matilda pled not guilty, and later filed an injunction against Lucius H. Levy, administrator of Frederick&#8217;s estate, to stop him from disposing of any property. </p>
<p>In March 1922, Matilda was sent to the East Louisiana hospital for the insane at Jackson. (We reckon that they have a slightly freer definition of madness in the south than in the Southland.) Released as cured in June 1923, last reports have her seeking control of her late husband&#8217;s extensive property holdings in Texas and California. </p>

But we are far from the Hotel Northern and Bunker Hill now, with a tale of love scorned ending up in a Louisiana madhouse. What of architect W.J. Saunders, a reinforced concrete specialist who made his name building the downtown lofts and warehouses which garnered deep fire insurance discounts for his clients? Among his notable projects were a charming Mission Style auto sales and service shop on Orange Street (1921, see drawing above), the remodeled <a href="https://cinematreasures.org/theater/3194/" target="_blank">Lynn Theater</a> in Laguna Beach (1930, still in operation, and variously described as being French-Norman and Mayan) and a supermarket at Wilshire and Camden Drive (1933) built for screenwriter Louis D. Lighton (&quot;Wings,&quot; &quot;It&quot;).  Among his surviving commercial structures is the massive five-story New Method Laundry Company plant on the northeast corner of Sixth and San Julian (1910, see below), featuring rows of novel windows that began at five feet above the ground and reached to the ceiling. It still makes a striking facade, despite a wretched paint job and a couple of missing floors.<br>
<img src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3081/2581679659_d5392ff571.jpg"></p>
<p><img src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3166/2581692005_7d8e2972b2.jpg"></p>
<p>But for his most unusual structure, Saunders served as his own client. This was the &quot;spite house,&quot; erected in 1907 at 2691 San Marino Street flush up against the property line of Saunders&#8217; neighbor Adolph Lowinsky, orchestra leader at the Angelus Hotel. This oddity was two stories high but only one room deep, with its staircase on the outside wall and no windows on the west side. </p>
<p>Lowinsky sputtered that this abomination existed purely to deprive his home of any natural light on the east side, and to block the view from his porch; other homeowners shared his revulsion at the bizarre addition to their block. Saunders countered &quot;I planned that house long before I ever knew Mr. Lowinsky. That is a flat building, and I believe it will prove lucrative!&quot; And anyway, Lowinsky had started it by pelting the Saunders children with stones and building an unsightly wall. Lowinsky further claimed that he and his day-sleeping wife had long been tortured by the Saunders brats, who rolled past the house on the sidewalk on noisy wagons, banged tin pans under their windows and yelled &quot;Sheeny&quot; whenever Lowinsky mowed his lawn. Saunders complained that Lowinsky pelted his children with pebbles, cursed at his wife and finally pointed a shotgun at him and threatened to blow his brains out. These battling neighbors aired their grubby laundry in a series of newspaper articles, but seem never to have actually sued or slain each other.. no doubt much to the disappointment of you, gentle reader.</p>
<p>You can today walk in Saunders&#8217; footsteps by joining his and the missus&#8217; club, the <a href="https://www.ruskinartclub.org/" target="_blank">Ruskin Art Club</a> (founded 1888 and still active). But please be kinder to the guy next door.</p>
