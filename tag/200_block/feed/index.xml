Not likely.</p>
<p>Across the Pasadena Freeway, on Bunker Hill proper, on the west side of Figueroa between First and Second, that big white structure?

Whatever the most photographed buildings on Bunker Hill were–the Castle, the Brousseau, the Dome?–if there”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s another image of <i>this</i> structure, I”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />d love to see it.<br />

123 was erected as an office building, but in 1934 is turned into “one of the largest and most modern” government relief centers in the West.  The Federal Transient Service converted the building into its Southern California headquarters, i.e., a shelter for non-resident jobless men, outfitting it with an enormous cafeteria and dormitories that slept 500.  It became a veritable city in itself:  showers, lockers, hospital, educational and recreational facilities were installed, as were a laundry, shoe repair and tailor shop.  It was also a warehouse for materials and supplies used in the camps.  Yes, the camps.  Itinerant men had forty-eight hours to stay at Figueroa, max, before being assigned out of the city to transient work camps in forest and mountain areas.</p>
<p>Families, bands of “wild boys,” vagabonds on freight cars”¦in 1935 32,000 new transients came to California each month, 12,000 of those to Los Angeles.  July of 1935 alone saw a load of 20,000  paupers arrive in LA seeking State and Federal aid.  (And, one supposes, oranges that grew on palm trees.)  1,200 boys were sent to forestry camps, 4,000 men to the Federal aid camp near San Diego, but many of LA”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s transients–12% of the national and 60% of the State”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s burden–after being processed here at 123 South Fig, ended up in squatter”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s villages and squalid encampments.  Many went to homes and camps, were absorbed to into County Welfare healthily, found employ in the works relief programs or went back from whence they came, but either way, it does show and say something about the class shift of the Hill that such a major locus of poverty and despair should be located within its confines.</p>
<p>123 is converted to the police department”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s traffic division headquarters building in 1942.  The City Council gave the Police Commission $78,000 for the building and another $47,000 for the alterations.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3406/3334898604_3eea6796e7_o.gif" alt="deadication" height="158" width="400" />At the dedication, during a luncheon given on the third floor, attended by Mayor Bowron, Chief of Police Horral, and numerous high ranking police officers, Deputy Police Chief Caldwell announced that Los Angeles led the nation in the decrease in auto fatalities–which occurred through “strict, scientific enforcement of driving regulations.”  (Reports from 123 show that pedestrian fatalities in the first half of the 40s skyrocketed–dimouts for the war effort, don”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t ya know.)</p>

The biggest piece of drama attached to the building came when in 1950 Parry Cottam, 27, a maintenance man at the police garage in the building, was moving a police motorcycle and it went out of control.  It plunged him through a large plate-glass window on the building”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s street level, and he was found unconscious on the sidewalk.  </p>

In March of 1964, the Board of Supervisors authorized sale of the county building to the CRA.  The CRA said they intended to develop the site into a motel.  The garage equipment goes up for auction in April 1971 and the 123 is presumably demolished failry soon thereafterward.  While the CRA didn”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t build a motel after clearing the site, the <a href="http://www.you-are-here.com/los_angeles/promenade.html" title="PTs" target="_blank">Promenade Towers</a>  have at least been described as a “<a href="http://www.apartmentratings.com/rate/CA-Los-Angeles-Promenade-Towers.html" title="thirtyonepercent" target="_blank">roach motel</a>.”</p>

It has its formal opening June 16, 1986, the name <i>Promenade</i> intending to connote the era of pedestrian-oriented urbanism this project will usher in.</p>

<p>The Promenade becomes a favorite of Union Bank; they keep sixteen apartments there for visiting businessmen.  Tommy Lasorda himself keeps a pad in the Prom.  They”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />re all drawn by the health club and gymnasium, market, pharmacy, dentist, cafÃ©/restaurant, the 24-hour reception and valet and garage attendants and so forth.  </p>

It remains to be seen whether the 123 regains its Reagan-era splendor, or if its residents, with their dry cleaner and little shop of sundries, doesn”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t harken back to its forgotten days as a haven for homeless men and law enforcement.</p>

<p>The Lovejoy is announced May 1903:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3416/3223821591_abb53e79ed_o.gif" alt="pulledpermits" height="55" width="400" /></p>
<p>142 rooms, divided into 78 apartments, it opens in November.</p>

<p>It is immediately the scene of many a large society wedding, and home to the known (William O. Owen lived at the Lovejoy when it was finally decreed, in 1927, that it was in fact he who first reached the summit of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Teton" title="greatteat" target="_blank">Grand Teton</a>).</p>
<p>The Lovejoy is also a hotbed of lefty activity. It”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s a center for the Equal Rights League and magnet for suffragists of various stripe. It”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s where Professor Flinn”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s “physical culture” class met in 1904. It also serves as the 1930s home for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_Against_War_and_Fascism" title="AL" target="_blank">American League Against War and Fascism</a>.</p>

<p>Above, looking north/east on Grand.  (Nice crenellated parapets. Despite being against war, its residents were probably glad for defensible battlements.)</p>
<p>Now you see Angels Flight Drugs:</p>

<p>Now you don&#8217;t:</p>

<p>This being Third and Grand, the Lovejoy was also across the street from the <a href="/NugentNewGrand" title="crosstheSt" target="_blank">Nugent</a>.  Below, the Nugent is on the left, and we peer down to Olive&#8230;there&#8217;s the top of Angels Flight, its neighbor the <a href="/elksannex" title="elxaugogo" target="_blank">Elks Lodge</a>, and the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ice_nyne/1911639696/" title="EdisonBldg" target="_blank">Edison</a>/Metro Water <a href="http://www.you-are-here.com/broadway/metropolitan_water.html" title="MWD" target="_blank">Bldng</a> at <a href="http://www.andreas-praefcke.de/carthalia/usa/usa_losangeles_million.htm" title="milliondolla" target="_blank">Third and Broadway</a> in the distance.</p>

<p>And, in our continuing effort to get you oriented, endless maps.</p>
<p>From the Sanborn Fire Insurance maps, 1906:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3508/3224776638_a114727685_o.gif" alt="Sanborn06" height="464" width="439" /></p>
<p>From the Birdseye:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3262/3224776594_7a6e59e4fa_o.gif" alt="3rdGrand09" height="346" width="454" /></p>
<p>From the Baists Real Estate Atlas, 1926:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3366/3223918391_4fdc54ca3f_o.gif" alt="baistyboy" height="454" width="575" /></p>
<p>And of course, the WPA model from 1940:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3436/3224776760_a8c458e64d_o.gif" alt="3andG" height="619" width="575" /></p>
<p>Above, the Nugent has lost the top of its tower.  And is also apparently falling over.</p>
<p>The Lovejoy stands strong, though painted yellow, as per its reputation for hosting pacifists.</p>
<p>The 1960s saw its demolition, and in its place, in the early 80s, the erection of a similarly formidable fortress, Isozaki&#8217;s <a href="http://www.magazineusa.com/us/cityguide/show.aspx?state=ca&amp;unit=losangeles&amp;doc=17&amp;dsc=MOCA" title="iso" target="_blank">Museum of Contemporary Art</a>.  Through true to the Hill, it&#8217;s styled less like a castle than it is bunker-like.</p>

Thomas Major Jr., 34, a logger by profession, down from Vancouver to take in the town.  He was in the barroom at the Rollin Hotel, Third and Flower, when the cops came in to investigate a brawl, January 24, 1960.  They have a funny way of doing things up in British Columbia, apparently, for as the bulls were bracing some other bar patron, Major pulled out a gun, pointed it at the cops”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> backs, and began pulling the trigger.  The cops heard the click-click of two empty chambers, turned, and fired seven shots at Major.</p>
<p>Major was hit seven times, taking four in the abdomen.  Detectives Pailing and Buckland, with Municipal Judge Griffith in tow, made a visit to Major”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s bed in the prison ward at General Hospital, where they charged him with two counts of assault with intent to commit murder and one of violating the deadly weapons control law.</p>
<p>The GH docs had pulled all sorts of lead from Major, but there was still the matter of the bullet in Major”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s <i>heart</i>.  Yes, normally a slug from a Parker-issued K-38 in the ticker is going to put you down for good.  But this one found its place there in an unsual way; one of those bullets to the abdomen apparently passed through the liver, entered a large vein and was pumped into the upper right chamber of the heart, passed through the valve to the lower left chamber, an in that ventricle there it sat.  Apparently you can”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t just leave well enough alone, so someone had to go in and get the damn thing.</p>
<p>Enter Drs. <a href="http://ats.ctsnetjournals.org/cgi/content/full/66/6/2132" title="lymanplace" target="_blank">Lyman Brewer</a> and Ellsworth Wareham, of the <a href="http://www.whitememorial.com/about/history/index.php" title="CME" target="_blank">College of Medical Evangelists</a>.

<p><a href="http://www.llu.edu/news/today/mar0404/mc.html#1" title="DrJoan" target="_blank">Dr. Joan Coggin</a>, who assisted, also noted that they”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />ve established a new approach to heart surgery in that they incised the heart on the underside, and not in the front; the electrical pattern of the heart, as evidenced by their electrocardiogram, has shown that this method results in far less serious consequence to the heart during surgery.  </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Holy Trinity of Noir:  the Tough Hood, the Tougher Cop, and the Dame.  The Dame–in peril, and perilous to know.</p>
<p>Tonight”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s tale takes this Trinitarian shape, but contains, oddly, but two players.</p>
<p>Our first adherent is Mr. X., aka Tough Hood.  He heard the clip-clop of heels reverberate throught the misty night air of February 7, 1944.  He followed his prey–the Dame, in peril, to her pad, and once she was inside, he attacked!<br />
<img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3418/3199752825_8f6407d351_o.gif" alt="madbadanddangeroustoknow" height="72" width="288" /><br />
Unfortunately for Tough Hood, Dame in peril, true to form, was perilous to know.  She was playing double duty as Tougher Cop.  Tough Hood had unwittingly attacked Miss Margaret Maguire, a deputy sheriff.  Mr. X ended up with only a purse strap, and a heart pumping blood and terror; Maguire chased him all the way out of the neighborhood.</p>
<p>Maguire lived at the Carleton (across the street from the <a href="/st_angelo" title="angieayangie" target="_blank">St. Angelo</a>).</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3300/3200599100_8b4b20099d_o.gif" alt="nojokesaboutyourdoorman" height="546" width="575" /></p>
<p>With a nod to its severe symmetry, Corinthian columns, and pointy pediment, Hill chronicler Hylen made sure to photograph Carleton&#8217;s backside as to juxtapose Neoclassical majesty with good old American tenement living:<img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3347/3199753363_89b469c94a_o.gif" alt="boweryboyz" height="484" width="575" /><br />
Some quick views of the east side of the 200 block of North Grand:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3493/3199824761_4478b3a6b6_o.gif" alt="fromthebe1909" align="left" height="211" width="327" />At left, from the Birdseye, the block in 1909; it”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s a bustling part of the world.</p>
<p>Below, the Sanborn Map, 1906.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3097/3200599620_5a6ce7b48a_o.gif" alt="block06" height="570" width="417" /></p>
<p>In 1950, most of the block was gone.  Only the Carleton, and a paltry few other structures, remain:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3112/3200599586_2b32c2571e_o.gif" alt="block50" height="565" width="417" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By 1952, they”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />d broken ground on the <a href="http://www.you-are-here.com/los_angeles/hall_of.html" title="HOA" target="_blank">Hall of Administration</a>.  So the 1953 Sanborn Map would have nothing to show for the Carleton&#8217;s time on Earth.</p>

<p>In the months since Mabel came out from Chicago, leaving behind her deadbeat husband and wee Leo in the charity hospital, she&#8217;d made a little home for the tyke in rooms on Bunker Hill. Then she sent for her child, and warned him never to leave the safety of his aerie while she toiled away downtown. </p>
<p>The child didn&#8217;t know his weak heart could give out if he ever dared take the steps down by Angels Flight, only that his mother had begged him not to exert himself. And so the child waited, crawling along Olive Street to peep out over the Third Street hill to the teeming town below. His little knees grew raw beneath his shabby trousers, and each night mama put a little more money in her purse, including the penny she saved by walking up the steps, to eventually replace Leonard&#8217;s costume.</p>
<p>And then, the unthinkable: Mabel&#8217;s boss told her that her own uniform was unsuitable and must be replaced. Of course she could sew the uniform herself, but the cost of the fabric would exhaust Leonard&#8217;s clothing fund. And so Mabel did what mothers have always done when the bills exceeded the cash on hand: she went into a department store, milled around cagily, and snatched up the yardage needed to craft her new attire. </p>
<p>But Mabel was no criminal, and her furtive movements attracted the attention of a <a href="http://www.nickharrisdetectives.com/nick.htm" target="_blank">Nick Harris</a> detective, who delivered the lady to the police department. There, Mabel spilled her sorrows, and the cops and independent detectives all gathered around to marvel at the pretty lady who would rather steal than whore herself–for in her place, any one of them would have taken that easier road. Then they arranged to have the charges dropped, then passed the hat and rewarded their little criminal with $15, a sum sufficient to buy a new uniform.</p>
<p>And then Mabel went back to her little son, and their grim life on Bunker Hill.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>May 6, 1915.  Mr. H. J. Robinson, of 210 South Flower, met long-time acquaintance Ernest Lightfoot at another house Robinson owned at 121 South Flower.  While the two were inspecting 121–Lightfoot had proposed Robinson trade him the house for some land in the Imperial Valley–Lightfoot slugged the elderly Robinson, knocking him unconscious.  </p>
<p>Robinson recovered consciousness enough to feel someone tugging at his diamond ring–which he”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />d never been able to get off himself, though Lightfoot was able to do enough of a number on Robinson”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s finger to effect removal.</p>
<p>While Robinson recovered in Westlake Hospital, suffering contusions of the head and a concussion of the brain (and a bruised finger), Lightfoot was picked up by detectives.  Turns out this Lightfoot was the same charmer who in 1910 was charged with rape and given five years probation, and who in 1914 was arrested for child abandonment.</p>

<p>Yes, 210 South Flower, which we know as the Stanley Apartments, as pictured <a href="/node/157" title="youknowforrobbers" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="/TheMarcella" title="andinthecomments" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

For the article they dug up one of the original uprooted persons, a Jim Dorr, 73, who”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />d been sent a notice by the CRA to vacate the Stanley Apartments on November 15, 1965.

<p>Sez Jim:</p>
<p>“I”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />ve been around Bunker Hill off and on now for forty or fifty years.  They say it was nice once.  But they let it run down for years.  The Stanley was a very old place, well kept, but they didn”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t spend much money on it.”</p>
<p>(Just for the record, despite what it says in the caption at right, the Bunker Hill Towers are not on the spot of the Stanley.  The Stanley is at the red hatched box below; Dorr&#8217;s standing at the blue dot.)</p>

<p>Looking down 2nd toward Hope.  (Needless to say, Bunker Hill Avenue has removed itself from the equation.)  (But then, so has pretty much everything else.)</p>
