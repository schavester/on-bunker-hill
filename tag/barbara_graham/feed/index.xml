										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2254/2660612112_3f255d818e_o.gif" alt="Marcella" height="592" width="575" />Today we discuss The Marcella, who once flaunted her classical order on Flower (she is Italian, please be advised the C in her name is not pronounced <i>s</i> as in <i>sell</i>, but like <i>ch</i> as in <i>chin</i>).  See how her name beckons, proud but not haughty, from her entablature?  She wants to take you in and protect you under that great cornice with her large corbels.  Despite her imposing presence, she is warm, and welcoming; the wide porches bespeak grace, and the timberframe vernacular on the bays coo <i>cozy by the fire lad, thereâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s good feelings in mortise and tenon</i>.  </p>
<p>But donâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t speak of  fire.  Fire struck the Marcella in October of 1912, sending well-to-do ladies like Mrs. L. M. Harvey to Pacific Hospital after having leapt from upper stories.  Other occupants hustled (stricken with panic; see below) and scantily attired into the street.  Marcella owner C. F. Holland states heâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s looking at $3,000 ($65,983 USD2007) in damages, $2,000 to the rugs and furniture alone.  <br />
<img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3236/2660611730_dcbcdcb8cb_o.gif" alt="PanicStricken" height="141" width="526" /><br />
It is reported that a man was seen running from the building a few minutes before the fire broke out.  The storeroom, where the fire began, was not locked.  The mystery is never solved but Marcella, stout of bay and stalwart of column, cannot be burned away.  She perseveres.<br />
<img loading="lazy" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2001/2660612342_da8059f7d9_o.gif" alt="Cometomother" height="820" width="575" /></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3002/2659783845_424d26486a_o.gif" alt="MayI?" align="left" height="399" width="211" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Marcella is a building so lovely she attracts only the comeliest of patrons.  She is home to Miss May Long, a lass so fetching that when in May of 1913 she turned her attentions to one Earl G. Horton, he is gunned down by another suitor outside of his apartment house near <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=1129+W+Temple+St,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90012&amp;sll=34.068214,-118.251193&amp;sspn=0.00855,0.013304&amp;layer=c&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=34.067841,-118.251235&amp;spn=0.00855,0.013304&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr&amp;cbll=34.063953,-118.25192&amp;panoid=GHaKiWGCNCAnGNrIWbCV1Q" title="shooting" target="_blank">Temple &amp; Victor</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jealousy over a woman causes upset <i>again</i> at the Marcella on October 25 of 1922 when Emergency Patrolman Claude Coffrin went to visit Mrs. Tillie Smith in her Marcella apartment.  Not long after Coffrin&#8217;s ingress, there appeared Emergency Patrolman Anthony Kazokas and a civilian, Joe Cummins.  Kazokas had loaned Cummins his revolver and badge to settle his romantic score with Coffrin over Tillie.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3222/2661876479_09a095e2ae_o.gif" alt="nothingbuttroubleItellya" height="117" width="488" /></p>
<p>Coffrin and Cummins fought, and Coffrin gained control of the gun; he phoned the Detective Bureau and over came officers Nickens and Ellis.  Cummins at that point grabbed the gun back from Coffrin and stuck it in Nickensâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> side, and Patrolman Kazokas jumped on Detective Ellis.  Ellis brained Kazokas out cold with the butt of his gun, but Nickens ended up shooting Cummins through the neck.  </p>
<p>The lovely Mrs. Smith was arrested on violation of parole; she had been sentenced on the 18th to pay $50 and spend thirty days in jailâ€”suspendedâ€”for â€œsocial vagrancyâ€.  Apparently, quality of young lady was beginning to decline at the Marcella.<br />
<img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3207/2659783783_d34bd5730f_o.jpg" alt="marcellaad" height="39" width="267" /><br />
Other upstanding members of society to grace the Marcellaâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s rooms were the Jacksons, of whom you read all about <a href="/node/118" title="NISA" target="_blank">here</a>. <br />
<img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3192/2661937757_978aa42f59_o.gif" alt="TheJackson2" height="335" width="459" /></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3007/2661992073_bde3d0b931_o.gif" alt="withliltommy" align="right" height="400" width="302" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And remember <a href="/iwantolive" title="idont" target="_blank">Barbara Graham</a>?  What helped send Barbara to the chair was hubby Henryâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s testimony on the witness stand.  Her last-ditch alibi was that she and Henry were together that night of March 9, 1953â€”but Henry testified he had already moved out and was living with his motherâ€¦at the Marcella.  (A mere two blocks down from the Lancaster, scene of Baxter Shorter&#8217;s abduction.)</p>
<p>Little Tommy Graham, now five, was living in the Marcella in 1957 when Wanger Pictures gave him $1000 for filming his executed motherâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s life story.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fire again struck the Marcella, this time in 1962, and this time it meant business.  On March 30 a blaze razed the upper two stories of the structure.  Twelve fire units quelled the blaze in half an hour; She of 223 South Flower vanished from memory soon afterward.</p>
<p>Here we are looking north on Flower through the intersection of Third, 1965.  See the little Victorian, left center?  The Marcella was just on the other side of that.<br />
<img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3091/2660612482_6fe71a9943_o.gif" alt="UpFlower" height="410" width="575" /><br />
Today Flower Street makes a sharp turn between Third and Second to avoid the Bunker Hill Towers.  The Marcella stood just on the other side of this pool:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3149/2661876651_01defdf94d_o.gif" alt="MarcellaToday" height="288" width="575" /> <br />

<p>Interesting, and, what, perhaps a little unnerving, but certainly instructive, to consider that the image that began this post, and the one immediately above, were taken from the same spot.</p>

</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">The story had all of the elements of a lurid tale from a sleazy detective magazine.<span>Â  </span>Barbara Graham, abandoned by her <img loading="lazy" border="0" align="right" width="240" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2290/2494344351_e7126a6604_m.jpg" alt="Santo Perkins Graham" height="170" />teenaged mother in <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Oakland</st1:place></st1:city> years before, had spent time in the same reformatory where her mom was an alumnus. Barbara had worked as a prostitute, and had become addicted to drugs. Sheâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />d been introduced to her co-defendants by none other than her husband, Henry, a small time career criminal. It was rumored that not only was Barbara having an affair with Perkins â€“ but also that she, Perkins, and <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Santos</st1:place></st1:city> were frequently engaged in threesomes. The press had a field day.</span>
</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"></span>
</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">The crime itself was apparently the result of misinformation given to Perkins. He was told that Mrs. Monahan (former mother-in-law of Las Vegas gambler Tutor Scherer) had a sack full of money and jewelry that she kept in her home (the same kind of tragic misunderstanding would result in the brutal murder of the Clutter family in Kansas in 1959, and become the subject of Truman Capoteâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s brilliant novel, â€œIn Cold Bloodâ€).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">On the night of March 9, 1953, the gang drove to Mrs. Monahanâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s home in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on">Burbank</st1:city></st1:place>. Barbara knocked on the front door and told the woman that her car had broken down, and asked to use the telephone.<span>Â  </span>The men were waiting right behind Barbara and before Mrs. Monahan could respond, they all pushed their way into the house where they immediately started screaming at her. The gang of strung out miscreants kept demanding to be told where she kept her money and jewelry.<o:p></o:p></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"><o:p>Â </o:p></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"><o:p></o:p></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">Mrs. Monahan repeatedly told the crooks that she didnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t keep cash at home, but they were so hopped up on drugs and adrenaline that they didnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t believe her.<span>Â  </span>One version of the story was that Barbara started to beat the victim with a pistol while the men laughed and egged her on. The older woman was beaten to the floor by â€œBloody Babsâ€, as she would later be dubbed by the press, who then smothered the victim to death by tightening a pillowcase over her head.<span>Â  </span>Not surprisingly, Babsâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> version of the story shifted the blame onto her partners.<span>Â  </span>But as far as the law was concerned, since all the defendants were present during the commission of the murder, they all shared the guilt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"><img loading="lazy" border="0" align="left" width="116" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2298/2495164948_6c6a6d3e13_m.jpg" alt="Baxter Shorter" height="240" /></span></p>

It was Baxter Shorter who decided to save himself by spilling his guts to the DA. Shorter was an ex-con and a known associate of LAâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s premier gangster, the diminutive but lethal Mickey Cohen. Shorterâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s friends got wind of his visits with the DA, and they became very nervous.</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"><o:p>Â </o:p></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">Baxter and his wife Olivia lived in an apartment at 121 N. Flower, and it was from that location that Shorter was kidnapped by two men. In a photo shown to her by police, Olivia identified one of<img loading="lazy" border="0" align="right" width="240" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2095/2495164990_a94ff2fd1b_m.jpg" alt="121 N Flower" height="195" /> the kidnappers as Emmett Perkins. The other man was almost certainly <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Santos</st1:place></st1:city>. No shrinking violet, Olivia tried halting the kidnapping by brandishing a 30-30 carbine at the husband snatchers, but they told her that theyâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />d shoot her where she stood if she didnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t back off. Olivia told the cops that she had seen a female in the menâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s car.

Once the car sped away, Baxter Shorter vanished forever.<span>Â  </span>Nary a bone fragment nor a tooth would ever surface, and he would be declared legally dead in 1960.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">Barbara maintained her innocence until the end. Being a mother of three, she may have avoided the death penalty if she<img loading="lazy" border="0" align="right" width="187" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2256/2494344297_ac81b8a481_m.jpg" alt="Barbara Graham" height="240" /> hadnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t made the mistake of offering a fellow inmate $25k to provide her with an alibi for the night of the murder.
