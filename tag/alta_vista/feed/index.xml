										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3163/2961815505_1fa14ca585_o.gif" alt="fromthetrailer" height="271" width="479" />Bunker Hill of old is gone, never to be again.  Until we concoct some Disneyesque Colonial Williamsburgian simulacrum, complete with sullen teenagers hired to pose as grimy grifters, weâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />ll never be able to amble down Third toward Hill and catch Angels Flight up to battenboard and gingerbread.  (Imagine, the collapse of the Vanderbilt will be repeated at two, four, and six!  Visit  the souvenir stand outside the Elmar!  We <i>gotta</i> get Eco on board.  Dang, too bad Baudrillard just died.)</p>
<p>But the Hill did rise again, for one brief moment, when Robert â€œChinatownâ€ Towne said <i>full speed ahead</i>, weâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />re building this thing.  Weâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />ve got <i>Ask the Dust</i> to film.  And with all that devalued Rand, what did they build down in a Capetown rugby field?  A presumptuous pastiche.  A goofy Golem.  A dopey doppelgÃ¤nger.  </p>
<p>Bear in mind this post is less a criticism than an investigation, because itâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s not so much they got it <i>wrong</i> as they got it <i>weird</i>.  </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3240/2963143040_15ee8075e9_o.gif" alt="AtD" align="right" height="300" width="200" />What is this <i>Asking of Dust</i>, you ask?  Fine, a little background.  Itâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s the 1930s, and while the world was awash in novels of the mannered drawing-room variety, aspiring writer John Fante was banging out gritty realism, as best he could, considering that at every turn heâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />d find the â€œmechanism of [his] new typewriter glutted with sand.â€  This is the titular dust, the tiny brown grains thatâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />d blow in from the Mojave, thatâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />d get in his hair and ears and find its way into the bedsheets of his little room at the Alta Loma, his Bunker Hill flop.  </p>
<p><i>Ask the Dust</i> <u>is</u> Bunker Hill.  And <i>AtD</i>â€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s protagonist Arturo Bandini is our displaced dago everyman, there at the Alta Loma, built on the hillside in reverse: he climbs out the window and scales the incline to the top of the Hill and walks â€œdown Olive Street past a dirty yellow apartment house still wet like a blotter from last nightâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s fog.â€  Via Fante/Bandiniâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s description, the Hill takes on all necessary romance and despair:</p>
<p align="justify">
<i>I went up to my room, up the dusty stairs of Bunker Hill, past the soot-covered frame buildings along that dark street, sand and oil and grease choking the futile palm trees standing like dying prisoners, chained to a little plot of ground with black pavement hiding their feet.  Dust and old buildings and old people sitting at windows, old people tottering out of doors, old people moving painfully along the dark street.</i>
</p>
<p>(In actuality, Fante wrote Ask the Dust in a [<a href="https://www.flickr.com/search/?q=berendo&amp;w=34632809%40N00" title="thanktheCity" target="_blank">recently-demolished</a>] <a href="https://www.meenophoto.com/fantehouseslideshow/" title="HouseofFante" target="_blank">pad</a> on Berendo.  But he <i>had</i> lived at the <a href="/taxonomy/term/115" title="theAVclub" target="_blank">Alta Vista</a>, seen here&#8230;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3147/2951656699_5a78d9373f_o.gif" alt="theAltaVista" height="498" width="450" /></p>
<p>&#8230;.and whose plot is now here:)</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3141/2951656881_4e6089de79_o.gif" alt="theyellowofcowardice" height="321" width="450" /></p>
<p>Anyway.  Robert Towne reads the 1939-published <i>Ask the Dust</i> in 1971 while doing research for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aifeXlnoqY" title="forgetaboutitrobert" target="_blank"><i>Chinatown</i>.</a>  Towne decides then and there to make a picture out of the novel; it takes him a while to do so.  Come 2006, voila, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5WDnF0sV5I" title="askthecritics" target="_blank"><i>Ask the Dust</i></a>.</p>
<p>I wonâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t comment on the performances or the diegetic structure of this <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ask_the_dust/" title="betterthanMaxPayne" target="_blank">oft-maligned</a> film.  While the reviewers cobbled cranky critiques, none cast aspersions on this piece of celluloid for any abuse of architectural accuracy.  I would, however, were I to have an appropriate forum to do so.  This being barely it, weâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />re off to the races.  </p>
<p>Towne beat his brains out making this movie, befriending Fante, writing the script on spec (unheard of for a man of his stature), jumping through every archetypally ugly financing hoop and unearthing some undiscovered ones in the process.  But yes, this labor of love paid off, because I was there opening day, ignoring the performances and diegetic structure to sit gape-mouthed atâ€”what else?  Bunker Hill.  And sit in wonder and disbelief I did, mostly at the sheer strange world into which Iâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />d been injected:   Bunker Hill was dementedly askew.  Therefore <i>I</i> was dementedly askew.  Well, Mr. D.A., I hear you say, if youâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />re so All That, <i>you</i> try to make period picture.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3029/2962379545_c5d14637c4_o.gif" alt="TreasureIsland" align="right" height="367" width="250" />I may only know the bare minimum about making period pictures, but at least itâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s something.  Ten years ago, Richard and Iâ€”Kimâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Richard, builder of this blogâ€”were the art department for â€œindieâ€ film <a href="https://www.kingpix.com/films/ti/production/" title="anislandofDoom" target="_blank"><i>Treasure Island</i></a>.   <i>Treasure Island</i> was shot on film and set in 1945â€”and who on earth has ever made a serious period feature with no budget?  We built sets in a makeshift soundstage, shot at locations with cajoled props in a manner that would make Ed Wood blush, and shut down City streets (necessary when staging a riot).    Thatâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s how you make a big, sprawling period picture (which went on to win the top honors at Sundance, the â€œSpecial Jury Prize for Distinctive Vision in Filmaking,â€ aka the coveted â€œWhat the Hell was <i>That</i>?! Awardâ€) for less than the latte budget of <i>Beverly Hills Chihuahua</i>:  make sure you have neither money nor expertise.  But Iâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />m not here to impugn the excesses of studio excrescence.  Iâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />m just pointing out that we did more with less.  We were <i>historically accurate</i>.  To an annoying degree. </p>
<p><i>Ask the Dust</i>, less so.  Oh, it looks great, but itâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Bunker Hill Bizarro.  Batman once pointed out to the Mystery gang that the Joker did first-rate counterfeiting, save for one thing:  President Lincoln never wore a turtleneck sweater.  Suffice it to say, Bunker Hillâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s neck will never get cold.</p>
<p>Consider.  Towne was in development on this project for thirty years.  During that time he could have learned the difference between the Second and Third Street tunnels.  Or spent an hour finding someone who did.  Look, no-one is here to talk smack about <i>Ask the Dust</i> Production Designer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D___SxnnW0&amp;feature=related" title="HP" target="_blank">Dennis Gassner</a>. Many have gone into production design to <i>be</i> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNspFSUv0nM" title="BFF" target="_blank">Dennis Gassner</a>.  And the production looks terrificâ€”but there are those among us will forever be at a loss to understand what the hell it was that Towne/Gassner &amp; his team/whoeverâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s responsible was <i>doing</i>.  </p>
<p><i><br />
Ask the Dust</i>â€”itâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s not that itâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s full of rampant anachronism (if <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCfflhAHbT0" title="ouch" target="_blank"><i>The Sting</i></a> is set in the 30s, why are they listening to 1890s Scott Joplin, and have 1970s hair?), nor does it feel just altogether wrong &amp; parachronistic (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xHwXleX9w0" title="doubleouch" target="_blank"><i>Ha! Ha! Harlem Nights!</i></a>)â€”no, itâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s anatopistic, which is a ten-dollar word meaning strange as all get out.  Instead of mere chronological anomaly, we have full-bore objet-out-of-place, for example, a tunnel thatâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s moved over.  (Iâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />m just talking about the giant corporeal set they built.  The actual CGI they dropped on top of it is a monument to chronological anomaly.  Weâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />ll get to that.)</p>
<p>Letâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s talk tunnels.  The designers read the script, and it says Angels Flight, Third Street.  Ok.  Art Department gets to work.  Now then:</p>
<p>This is the Third Street tunnel:<br />
<img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3211/2959012656_cb48c9195e_o.gif" alt="TSS" height="329" width="575" /></p>
<p>This is the Second Street tunnel:<br />
<img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3198/2962466919_e92c6c2953_o.gif" alt="SST" height="264" width="575" /></p>
<p>This is what they elected to build:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3024/2962785174_9787fd5208_o.gif" alt="SST2000" height="356" width="575" /><br />
Hence:<br />
<img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3050/2961816749_7538d4242b_o.gif" alt="FancifulBH" height="412" width="575" /></p>
<p>Got it?  Itâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s the Second Street tunnel with Angels Flight next to it.  And other Third Street whatnot atop.  Some of it, anyhow.</p>
<p>This is no mere clickety-clack of computer, or making of matte painting (do people still do those?), this was <i>built</i>:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3217/2961815619_5696c9d6f3_o.gif" alt="tunnelofyore" height="204" width="400" /></p>
<p>1924 looked just like 2004&#8230;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3232/2961937633_33ef85f81a_o.gif" alt="sstunderconstruction" height="327" width="575" /></p>
<p>Yes, I find this peternaturally exciting, but then, I need to get out more.  In any event:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3050/2961816749_0a7267d6fd_m.jpg" alt="fancifulsmaller" align="left" height="172" width="240" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s again turn our attention to <i>AtD</i>&#8216;s  world of Third and Hill, 1933.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3279/2961816441_00473c55ab_o.gif" alt="3HCrock" height="448" width="400" /></p>
<p>Here then is your standard pre-June 1908 <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/crocker_mansion" title="theCrock" target="_blank">Crocker Mansion</a> shot.  Thereâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s the Crock, the observation tower, no Elks gate of course.  Down from the Crocker thereâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s the Nelson House and the Ferguson house.  On the east side of the street, in descending order, the Hillcrest, the Sunshine Apartments, the McCoy House, and the St. Helena Sanitarium.  </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3039/2961816267_31131c5570_o.gif" alt="elksahoy" align="right" height="409" width="294" />What I find really intriguing in <i>Ask the Dust</i>â€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s interpretation is the inclusion of the six-bay arched entry to Angels Flight, up top on Olive Street (you can see four of the open bays because the two on the left were closed in for the ticket booth).  This pavilion would naturally butt up against the Hillcrest, but because the tunnel below is now so <i>wide</i>, there exists this odd <i>empty</i> area.  The six-bay pavilion up top also thrusts us into an all the more peculiar place within the time-space continuum; it only existed between 1910 and 1914.  While the Crocker Mansion existed before 1908.  And the here-absent Observation Tower was not removed until 1938, five years after the <i>Ask the Dust</i> shot was â€œtaken.â€</p>
<p>So why use the Second Street tunnel and not the Third?  I have a possible explanation for this.  Here is a passage from the book:</p>
<div align="justify">
<i>I took the steps down Angelâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Flight to Hill Street:  a hundred and forty steps, with tight fists, frightened of no man, but scared of the Third Street Tunnel, scared to walk through itâ€”claustrophobia. </i>
</div>
<p>So there you have it.  They <i>couldnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t</i> build the Third Street tunnel because Bandiniâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s character was scared ofâ€¦so they built theâ€¦OK, so there was a time when everyone was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YB2lrrOJgg&amp;feature=related" title="1942thesequel" target="_blank">coked out of their skulls </a>and something like that could have occured. But nowadays thereâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s oversight, and bottom lines, and so on.  Right?</p>
<p>But go back to the <i>Ask the Dust</i> image.  The (pre-1933) Ferguson home  down on the street by Angels Flight is sort of correct, though its gable faced at an angle to the street.  And where is the entry arch to Angels Flight, pre-1910 or post?  The buildings on the other side of the street are entirely fancifulâ€¦vaguely correct in their massing, but thatâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s about it.  The Hillcrest never had bay windows.  The McCoy house wasnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t double gabledâ€”and the Sunshine Apts are gone, presumably so that the Sanitarium could be shoved up the hill.  </p>
<p>In theory Gassner made a conscious aesthetic decision to go with the Crocker because it played better visually.  Or there was an unpaid intern who saw a stack of postcards and slapped this together.</p>

(Also, the Confederacy won, and because of that we have gills.

The Alta Loma slopes down to Hill Street, in the middle of the 300 blockâ€”to the right of the St. Paul neon.</p>
<p>Back in the day, in the 300 block, that St. Paul Hotel was the site of the Western Mutual Life Bldng, the Alta Loma where the Hotel Columbia stood.</p>

<p>The entrance to the tunnel is on the right; the Alta Loma, bottom center.</p>

<p>It gets barely a nod in the film.  (Probably because while they constructed a working PE Red Car that got lots of camera time, there were no Olivet or Sinai.)

Yes, impressive, impressive work.  Now consider, if all had been perfect, what would I have had to write about?</p>

<p>Location: 255 South Bunker Hill Avenue<br />
Date: October 31, 1904</p>
<p>It was a week ago when newspaperman W.D. Van Blarcom, Jr., known as Van,Â  helped wife Emily, a Wyoming gal and a gifted china painter, onto the white, ascending Angels&#8217; Flight carriage and made a most distressing speech: &quot;I can&#8217;t be good; I want to be bad. I shall be bad. My brothers and sisters have always said that I was the black sheep in the family. Now I will prove to them that I am. Good-bye. Go home and wait for me.&quot; </p>
<p>She did as she was told and went back to their three-room apartment in the Alta Vista, but there has been no word from Van since and the lady is half mad with worry and regret. When visited by a reporter she was being closely watched by friends who feared she would make good on her threats of suicide. </p>
<p>Her story: &quot;My life has become a blank. It is as if I had run against a stone wall. I shall commit suicide. If only he would come backâ€”if only he would let me know why he wentâ€”if only I could go to him. And yet they say he has done this thing before. I have reported his disappearance to the police and they can get no trace of him. One minute I believe he has committed suicide and the next I believe there is a woman in the case. Yesâ€”there must be a woman in the case. But in any event, there is nothing left for me. I shall take my life. About a week ago I was arranging some of his clothes in a closet, when a bundle of letters fell on the floor. One of them was from a woman in San Francisco, in which she wrote of a violent attachment for my husband, and added: &#8216;I suppose you are having a lovely time with you &#8212;.&#8217; I am the blank! Think of it! We had a little tiff over this letter and in taking it away from me he tore my arm with his nails, see, here is the sore place yet. Then when I agreed to burn it up and he saw me do so he swore with uplifted hand an oath to his dead mother than nothing but death could separate us. That was just a week ago today. Last Monday he was very despondent and did not come home as promised, and I went down to the newspaper office where he was working and tried to cheer him up. Then I went to Secretary Stevens of the Elks lodge and had him telephone my husband and ask him what was the matter. &#8216;Everything is all right now; tell her to come over here at once,&#8217; he answered. I went and that is when he took me to the foot of the Angels&#8217; Flight and told me that he wanted to be bad. Finally he sad that he would come home at 3 o&#8217;clock in the morning, but he never came.&quot;</p>
<p>The couple married last Christmas in Salt Lake, three months after Van&#8217;s divorce (Emily was four years divorced from a Mr. Miner), and came to Los Angeles via Portland and San Francisco. They choose this town for the climate, which they hoped would aid Van&#8217;s lung ailment (he said he&#8217;d been shot through the chest while representing the Associated Press in Cuba during the war with Spain). He quickly got work on the <i>Herald</i>, but after ten days moved over to the <i>Examiner</i>, and was so employed at the time of his disappearance. Police doubt he&#8217;s killed himself, although friends say he spoke often of doing so, since his last act before vanishing was to pawn Emily&#8217;s $50 gold watch. But as he was an Elk, the brothers have taken up a collection to pay the passage of the destitute bride back to her friends in Utah. Where, by the by, he abandoned his last wife in just the same way he did this one.</p>
<p>Emily said that Van was related to Lincoln portraitist <a href="https://lincoln.lib.niu.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3360:11:83.lincoln" target="_blank">A.J. Conant</a> and to the wealthy St. Louis Van Blarcomsâ€”a branch with a <a href="https://www.frederickok.org/History/Name.htm" target="_blank">blackish sheep</a> of its own. </p>
<p>We hear no more of him until 1936, when an obituary appears for an old newspaperman of the right name, approximate age and career history, passing from arthritis in Bakersfield and leaving an unnamed widow, a son and a daughter. Was the widow Emily, or some later wife who was better able to salt this bounder&#8217;s wings? </p>
<p>*note: Angels&#8217; Flight has its oft-missing possessive in the 1904 article in the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> from which this entry is adapted.<br />

<p>Location: 255 South Bunker Hill Avenue<br />
Date: August 13, 1933</p>
<p>The newlyweds kept a modest apartment here at the Alta Vista. Oh, it may have been something of a step down in the world for bride Harriet Fencel Easton Allen, 25, who had attended USC and UCLA and studied art for two years in Europe, and whose father John was former superintendent of the L.A. Athletic Club and manager of the Jonathan Club, but then again, it was convenient to husband Robert Allen&#8217;s cafe at 257 South Olive.</p>
<p>Early this morning, Harriet woke to a knock on the door, and she answered without waking Robert, but soon she was screaming and running back toward the bedroom, &quot;Bob, Bob, wake up! It&#8217;s Bruce!&quot;</p>
<p>Yes, it was T. Bruce Moore, 42-year-old drug clerk, longtime friend of Bob&#8217;s and rival for Harriet&#8217;s affections, and he had a gun in his hand. Just a few days ago he&#8217;d gone into the cafe and said that if Bob didn&#8217;t make Harriet happy, he&#8217;d kill him, but he&#8217;d apparently reconsidered, because it was pajama-clad Harriet whose brains he blew out. She fell at her husband&#8217;s feet as he woke in confusion, then saw her assailant shoot himself in the head. Moore lingered for a few hours at Georgia Street Receiving Hospital before dying. </p>
<p>In the killer&#8217;s pockets were year-old seaside photos of himself with the dead woman, and on the back of one he&#8217;d penciled a last will and testament leaving his insurance, furniture and some land in Arizona, total value $2255 to his sister Elsie Bitner. But this will would be challenged in court when Mrs. Carol E. Moore came forward claiming to be Moore&#8217;s widow, as their divorce decree had not been entered at the time of his death.</p>

Date: August 24, 1937</p>
<p>Traffic expert Edmund C. Easton of this address spoke today before the Police Commission. Based on his fifteen years of study of automotive congestion in Los Angeles and other large cities, Easton advised the following measures for easing gridlock: street clearance through adequate design, regulation and police enforcement, trolleys given right-of-way, one-way streets, and controlling both jaywalking and automobiles &quot;shooting&quot; into cross-sections. The Chief is considering his suggestions, and we are certain that by 1940, traffic jams will be but a distant memory to our burg.</p>

Date: March 1, 1935</p>
<p>In Municipal Court today, Judge Scheinman found George Parent, 32, bookkeeper of this address, guilty of petty theft on the accusation of attorney Stewart P. Fisher. Fisher said he&#8217;d given Parent $6 to bet on Gillie in a horse race on February 16, but that the bet was not placed. Parent&#8217;s unconvincing defense was that he believed that because Gillie&#8217;s stable mate Peradventure had been scratched, Gillie was not open for a bet. After his conviction, Parent asked for probation, and a hearing was set for March 7.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Location: 255 South Bunker Hill Avenue<br />
Date: January 22, 1918</p>
<p>Herbert Maas, 19, resident of the Alta Vista at 255 South Bunker Hill Avenue, was strolling with Alice Averill of 332 South Bunker Hill near Fifth and Fremont Streets when they were accosted by a four bandits who pulled up beside them in a car. Two of the men jumped out and grabbed Herbert, hustling him into the back seat. Then they drove away, leaving Miss Averill on the sidewalk. Near Orange and Figueroa the crooks relieved Herbert at gunpoint of $15, a gold watch and a stickpin. He must have been anticipating they&#8217;d soon release him when the man on his left, shaking from nervousness, suddenly fired his weapon. The bullet went through Herbert&#8217;s back, and next thing he knew, he&#8217;d been shoved onto the street in front of 1127 Orange Street. The wounded man made it into the Baltic Apartments, where he found aid and was taken to the Receiving Hospital, where he was listed in serious condition with a bullet through his lumbar region possibly nicking his peritoneum. A search was on for the highwayman, but there was no further news published about Herbert&#8217;s condition or any arrests. Ten years later, an Alice Averill was appearing around town as a chorus girl, in &quot;Topsy and Eva&quot; (a part she repeated on Broadway) and &quot;A Connecticut Yankee.&quot;</p>
