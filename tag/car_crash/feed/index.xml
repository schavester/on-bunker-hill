Which is probably a good thing, since rain will put out all that pesky <i>fire</i>.</p>
<p>Corner of Fourth and Olive, August 29, 1962.</p>
<p>Van R. Alexanian, 23, was loading a barrel of rubbish into the scoop on the front of his trash-truck when the parking brake gave way.  The truck ran into an electrical pole, and the live wire caught the truck debris on fire.  The pole then fell onto a Mrs. Helen Stairs, 50.</p>
<p>The flaming truck went on to take out a traffic signal and a lamp post before crashing into a garage.  This much was fortunate; the garage attendant was equipped with a fire extinguisher.</p>

<p>
Officer L. S. Rasic commented that had the truck continued through the intersection, it would have crashed into eight cars waiting for the signal to change.</p>
<p>The question remains as to what garage the garbage truck plowed into, as there were in fact three at Olive and Fourth:  the 1923 Mutual Garage at the NE corner, the 1919 Hotel Clark/Center Garage at the SE corner, and the 1923 Savoy Garage at the SW corner.  Here&#8217;s a picture of all three, 1966:</p>

The 600-car Mutual at left in the image above is now the foundation for <a href="http://www.you-are-here.com/los_angeles/californiaplaza.html" title="CP2" target="_blank">Cal Plaza Two</a>.  The Hotel Clark Garage, center (along with that tall white building, ironically named the <a href="http://jpg1.lapl.org/pics26/00032547.jpg" title="larryjew" target="_blank">Black Building</a>) is still an empty lot, site of what was to be <a href="http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Confusion+greets+Three+Cal+Plaza+default+notice,+some+see+union+tie-a013927656" title="C3PO" target="_blank">Cal Plaza Three</a>.  (The parking lot at foreground right was the former site of the <a href="/taxonomy/term/372" title="TheFreeMonte" target="_blank">Fremont</a>.)</p>
