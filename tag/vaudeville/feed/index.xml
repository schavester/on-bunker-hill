										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>*[Update to this post: after reviewing other newly digitzed footage shot on the same day as the Wall of Death discussed below, George Mann&#8217;s son Brad Smith now believes that this footage was actually shot at the <i>Oakland</i> Orpheum Theatre, sometime between March 31-April 6, 1928. The act and the players were identical to what was seen in March 1928 in Los Angeles.]</b></p>
<p>Today On Bunker Hill is proud to present another little something special from the archives of George Mann, an artifact that predates his astonishing <a href="/georgemannshop" target="_blank">color photographs</a> of Bunker Hill by about thirty years.</p>
<p>In March 1928, the comedic dance team of Barto &amp; Mann were billed on the vaudeville stage of Los Angeles&#8217; Orpheum Theatre with a slew of acts who are today mostly forgotten, but who had reached the top of a very competitive entertainment industry. It was during this run that the very-small-and-awful-tall Barto &amp; Mann were praised by the <i>L.A. Times</i> as &#8220;a knockout team.&#8221;</p>
<p><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4053/4653170710_c9ba1e7084.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>A not-yet-39 Jack Benny was on the bill, as was the magician <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVe7chIgn0w" target="_blank">Cardini</a> (still billed as &#8220;The Gay Deceiver;&#8221; later on, he became &#8220;Suave&#8221;). <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQvZUltlRRw&amp;feature=related" target="_blank">Charlotte Greenwood</a> appeared &#8220;in her morning bath&#8221; &#8212; a bit in which the dancer-comedienne was forever stopped from disrobing by the inopportune arrival of a range of visitors. Also appearing were the pratfalling comic <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qPkJag707o&amp;feature=relmfu" target="_blank">Lupino Lane</a> (Ida&#8217;s uncle), <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0875877/" target="_blank">Harland Tucker</a> and <a href="http://content.lib.washington.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/sayrepublic&amp;CISOPTR=2974&amp;CISOBOX=1&amp;REC=8" target="_blank">Carl McCullough</a> singing &#8220;When I Was a Dandy and You Were a Belle.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then there was the <a href="http://www.thewallofdeath.co.uk/early44.htm" target="_blank">Tom Davies Trio</a>&#8211;up at the top of the bill, but something of a mystery until the film snippet below was digitized by George Mann&#8217;s son Brad Smith, some 84 years after his father captured this astonishing scene.</p>
<p>Friends, we bring you the celebrated and terrifying <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_of_death_(carnival_sideshow)" target="_blank">Wall of Death</a>, live on the Orpheum stage! And in July 2012, you can see the first <a href="http://lavatransforms.org/mann7122012" target="_blank">exhibition</a> anywhere of George Mann&#8217;s Bunker Hill photographs, just steps away from the Orpheum at the Take My Picture gallery.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today On Bunker Hill is proud to present another little something special from the archives of George Mann, an artifact that predates his astonishing <a href="/georgemannshop" target="_blank">color photographs</a> of Bunker Hill by about thirty years.</p>
<p>Before he came up to the hill to take pictures, George was half of the comedic vaudeville dance team Barto &amp; Mann. In 1928, he filmed his friend W.C. Fields in that comic performer&#8217;s headlining role in the Earl Carroll Vanities, at Carroll&#8217;s 7th Avenue Manhattan theater. Barto &amp; Mann were also on the bill.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Mormon&#8217;s Prayer&#8221; was an opportunity to highlight the famously stunning Carroll showgirls (choreographed by Busby Berkeley) while giving the urban audience a chance to snicker at the erotic excesses of backwoods believers. We&#8217;re truly thrilled to present to you this lost moment of American theater history, as a follow-up to the newly discovered color George Mann footage of the <a href="/threestooges" target="_blank">Three Stooges</a> at Atlantic City.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/d_3SVBSd9R0" width="640" height="480" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Fields was paid $5200 a week for his several appearances during the show, which culminated in an outrageous routine, &#8220;Episode at the Dentist&#8217;s&#8221; (later expanded and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmCp-EGBsbY" target="_blank">filmed</a>) in which flying teeth and whirring drills terrorized and delighted the packed house. Among Dr. Pain&#8217;s (Fields) &#8220;victims&#8221; was the gorgeous, half-naked and dumb-as-a-post star of the Vanities, Dorothy Knapp (&#8220;The Most Beautiful Girl in the World&#8221;). We will refrain from any crass remarks about wishing to &#8220;drill&#8221; her.</p>

<p>If you enjoyed the <a href="/wcfields" target="_blank">recent posting</a> of George&#8217;s silent footage of W.C. Fields on stage as a worried Mormon husband about to hop into the sack with a bevy of Earl Carroll showgirls, you&#8217;ll thrill to see the lively home movie footage of Fields yucking it up with a tennis racket, filmed when both performers were appearing in the Earl Carroll Vanities.</p>
<p>You met him here first, but our pal George Mann is becoming quite the internet sensation. Critic Leonard Maltin <a href="http://blogs.indiewire.com/leonardmaltin/real-faux-silent-footage-worth-watching" target="_blank">dedicated</a> much of a recent blog post to Mann&#8217;s rediscovered silent film footage of Fields and the Three Stooges.</p>
<p>Keeping watching this space, as there more amazing short films coming from the George Mann Archives, starring some incredible entertainers. And for now&#8230; more Bill Fields!</p>
