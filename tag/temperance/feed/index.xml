<p>But truth be told, the Nugent was never a hotbed of vice, should you be perusing our <i>OBH</i> blog to sate your currish needs.  Heck, a 1905 article about the original <a href="https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;id=8h7yZGEsFmEC&amp;dq=%22white+ribboners%22&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=wdr3H-8lms&amp;sig=YlZoLUpeet5PPn2U7PqJKgoolfU&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ct=result#PPA2,M1" title="WCTYou" target="_blank" rel="noopener">White Ribboners</a> who fought demon drink back in the early ”˜70s mentions that crusading Quaker Josephine Marlatt chose the newly-opened Nugent as her home.</p>

Dean.  It was March 10, 1935, and Dean was busy plying his honest trade out in Pomona at a railroad right of way while a train crew was switching freight cars in the local yards.  Then some woman, as high and as mighty as they come, decided to drive her automobile across said railroad right of way; this enraged Dean, who pitched his lantern through her car windshield.  Unfortunately the woman was Mrs. Lois Browning, wife of Desk Sergeant Browning of the local police force, which might give some insight into her high-and-mightiness.</p>

I must admit, my inclusion of the Nugent (which became the New Grand some time in the 1940s, to be pulled down in the mid-1960s by the CRA, naturally, <i>ad victoriam</i>) is due in larg<img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3171/2932814347_9e7d6d3f3c_o.gif" alt="1961" align="right" height="41" width="344" />e part to the wonderful color image I am fortunate enough to here include.</p>

<p>Bunker Hill had, without question, the highest per-block concentration of Corinthian capitals in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One does have to wonder as to whether the two-story Corinthian columns were always broken up by those fire escapes.  </p>

<p>The deli has become a KooKooRoo.  I had half a mind to march in there and say <i>yeah, gimme a couple of your LandjÃ¤ger, and a Csabai KolbÃ¡sz, and a half pound of something Italian, Sopressata maybe, sliced thick, and something Jewish for the wife, say a pound of brisket, then let me have a fist-sized thing of herring, in brine not cream, and a pickled egg to go</i> but of course like the rest of Bunker Hill, there was no-one there.</p>

<p>With the New Grand gone, the 1970s and 80s thrilled to this hole in the ground.  (Here, we are facing the other way down Grand from the image above.)  At left, the 1982 Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill Crocker Tower II and at right, the 1973 AC Martin Security Pacific National Bank Plaza tower, butting up against Third (the road in the foreground would become   Thaddeus Kosciusko).  Then West-LA Nadel Architects (who are at present in charge of designing two thirty-story towers at Third &amp; Beaudry) showed up in 1988 and said <i>here</i>:</p>

Not really. As I alluded to earlier, this post is really all about the Nugent/New Grand, 1952–<i>in color</i>:</p>
