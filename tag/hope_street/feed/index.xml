The Bunker Hill of Israel Putnam and his bayoneted muzzleloader, not the Bunker Hill of <a href="/SecondBattleofBunkerHill" title="secondbattlebunkerhill" target="_blank">Albert Duarte and his oversized bow</a>.  Perhaps because of the revolutionary association to the Bunker Hill appellation, and because Bunker Hill in the pre-Crash era still held some credibility and panache, it was to where the Sons of the Revolution came to have their library, 437 South Hope Street.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.sr1776.org/SiteResources/Data/Templates/t1.asp?docid=514&amp;DocName=Home" title="GSSR" target="_blank">Sons of the Revolution</a>â€”open to those with a lineal descent from those who fought for the Patriot cause (not as hard to get into as the <a href="https://www.societyofthecincinnati.org/" title="SOC" target="_blank">Society of Cincinnati</a>, but harder to get into than the <a href="https://www.sar.org/" title="SAR" target="_blank">Sons of the American Revolution</a>, which wasnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t founded til thirteen years after the Sons of the Revolution, for reasons I wonâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t get into here)â€”seeks to forever keep alive the first men to fight for our treasured traditions.  And perhaps because YOU had some great great somebody at Cowanâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Ford, they keep a genealogical library so that you may do the necessary research into possible membership.  Today, their 110-year-old collection has 30,000+ volumes kept open to the public, free of charge, in Glendale; but the road there has been bumpy, save for forty years of comparative calm on the Hill.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.srcalifornia.com/nav2.htm" title="SRC" target="_blank">Sons of the Revolution of California</a> was founded in 1893, and by the turn of the century had some 5,000 volumes regarding the Revolution and Colonial America, especially in relation to the West.  Its first establishment was in the offices of the Societyâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s first President, Col. Holdridge Ozro Collins.  <img loading="lazy" src="https://farm1.static.flickr.com/248/3264127111_83ce1d982f_o.gif" alt="colCollins" height="247" width="222" />Collins was a Los Angeles lawyer (who, besides organizing the California Sons of the Revolution and Society of Colonial Wars, was Mayflower Society, Colonial Governors, Society of the War of 1812, Knights Templar, and Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company of Massachusetts) whose officers were in the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/7294653@N07/2959852285/" title="BrysonBlock" target="_blank">Bryson Block</a>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3363/3264128893_5f5d830166_o.gif" alt="brysonb4" align="left" height="280" width="260" /><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm1.static.flickr.com/241/3264129907_516afe1c17_o.gif" alt="brysonafter" align="right" height="280" width="218" /></p>
<p>
Bonebrake-Bryson Block (Joseph Cather Newsom, 1888), NW corner of Second and Spring, shown here before and after its remodel.  It was further remodeled into an open pit, as its corner site is now where the 1948 <a href="https://www.you-are-here.com/los_angeles/mirror.html" title="TM" target="_blank">Times Mirror Building</a> stands.</p>
<p>The Society stayed in the Bryson Block from May of 1893 until June of 1894, when Collins moved his offices, and the library, into the brand-spanking-new Stimson Block (Carroll H. Brown, 1893), NE corner of Spring and Third.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm2.static.flickr.com/1377/3264452149_c9371b4c94_o.gif" alt="chicagoesque" height="73" width="350" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Stimson Block was the first six-story building in Los Angeles, the first steel frame building in Los Angeles, and the last major example of commercial Richardsonian Romanesque in Los Angeles when it was unceremoniously demolished for a parking lot in July of 1963.  (We do have a good extant Victorian Richardsonian <i>house</i>â€¦and itâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s <a href="https://bigorangelandmarks.blogspot.com/2009/02/no-212-stimson-residence.html" title="stimsonhaus" target="_blank">also Stimsonâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s</a>.)</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3382/3264128241_3dd3b9513c_o.gif" alt="63demo" height="69" width="449" /></p>
<p>In any event, Collins and the library stayed at Stimson Block until it was decided that it was time for Col. Collins to get his room back, and for the library to have a place of its own.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3495/3264953858_6270caabd0_o.gif" alt="hennerendering" align="left" height="314" width="250" />So when the Henne Building, 122 West Third, a five-story French Renaissance office building also designed by Carrol H. Brown opened in the Spring of 1897, the Society took out an office.  The Henne site, west side of Third between Main and Spring, is now buried under the <a href="https://college.usc.edu/geography/la_walking_tour/civic_center/reagan_building.html" title="RRSOB" target="_blank">Ronald Reagan State Building</a> (Welton Becket and Associates, 1990). </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm1.static.flickr.com/236/3264127361_0e7bd824a0_o.gif" alt="henneshot" height="272" width="222" /></p>
<p>But the Society kept growing, and a decade laterâ€”January, 1908â€”they were moving boxes into the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/fridayinla/544210848/" title="SFB" target="_blank">San Fernando Building</a> (John F. Blee, 1906), SE corner Fourth and Main.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3522/3264127195_d83fc1629c_o.gif" alt="FernandoPic" height="222" width="222" /></p>
<p>They started knocking out walls on the sixth floor until additional stories were added in 1912 and the Society moved into quarters specifically designed for the library.  By 1914, they outgrew even that and had to take on an additional room.  Making matters worse (good for the library, bad for space concerns) was that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orra_E._Monnette" title="money" target="_blank">Orra Eugene Monette</a>, aka Mr. Bank of America, Society President, (Mayflower, Colonial Wars, Huguenot Society, ad infinitum) gave a large collection to the library.<img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3394/3264127781_bf2051460c_o.gif" alt="OEM" height="221" width="222" /></p>
<p>Again showing their preference for new buildings, the Society turned their eye to the new <a href="https://www.parkinsonarchitecture.com/map/22.html" title="CITBnk" target="_blank">Citizenâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s National Bank Building</a> (Parkinson &amp; Bergstorm, 1914) at the NE corner of Fifth and Spring; the building is still there, but has mysteriously been <a href="https://www.you-are-here.com/downtown/crocker_bank.html" title="strippy" target="_blank">stripped of its architectural embellishments</a>. <img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3297/3264127285_e7b88c6b9d_o.gif" alt="parky" height="304" width="222" /></p>
<p>And there they stayed until Nathan Wilson Stowell donated to the Society a plot of land on Bunker Hill.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm1.static.flickr.com/247/3264127543_18641e51f9_o.gif" alt="NWS" align="left" height="300" width="216" /> <img loading="lazy" src="https://farm1.static.flickr.com/193/3264952280_804938739e_o.gif" alt="stowell" align="right" height="270" width="222" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3494/3264954500_498cbc01d0_o.gif" alt="stowellhotel" align="right" height="313" width="200" />As a master of pipe and irrigation, Stowell became one of the great Southland water gods; in 1889 he built the Stowell Building, AKA the Germain Bldng, at 224 S. Spring (first five-story building in Los Angeles with an electric elevator) and fans of Spring Street surely know the 1913 Stowell Hotel; he built the <a href="https://cinematreasures.org/theater/16/" title="Mayan" target="_blank">Mayan Theater</a>  and financed the <a href="/TheDirtPatchofSecondandHill#comment-38" title="SST" target="_blank">1924 Second Street tunnel</a>.</p>
<p>When Stowell died in 1943, he was the last of the 20 charter members of the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce.  (And although his forebear who came to Massachusettes in 1620 was named Samuel, and the rest of his mishpucha are variously named Abraham, Isaac and Israel, Nathan maintains he is a Protestant.)  Despite his importance to the history of Los Angeles, or perhaps because of it, some cultural terrorist elected not to restore his name to the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/search/?s=int&amp;w=all&amp;q=el+dorado+lofts+downtown&amp;m=text" title="stowellinterior" target="_blank">Stowell</a>, which was renamed the Earle in 1950 after its acquisition by the Milner chain, and redubbed the <a href="https://www.eldoradolofts.com/" title="itscalledthestowelldammit" target="_blank">El Dorado</a> in 1955. </p>
<p>So Stowell donates the land to the Society and made a point of submitting his own plans for the building, to cost $25,000.  In October 1927, they held a ceremonial groundbreaking to turn the first shovelful of earth:</p>

<p>Inside, what more could one ask for?</p>

<p>The secretaire with broken pediment, the Ionic capitals, the Doric pilasters, the plaster medallion, the comforting keystone?  One can gain an almost perfect serenity from gazing into this image (imagining the hypnotic tick-tock of an Elias Ingraham on the mantel&#8230;kept me in ataraxia all these feverish months, allowing me to postpone this post to <a href="https://www.mountvernon.org/support/why_support_mount_vernon/index.cfm/" title="supportMV" target="_blank">Presidentâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Day</a>).</p>

<p>While the library naturally abjured the wild Bunker bacchanal, perhaps we should make mention that it did have some interesting neighbors (okay, so this post doesnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t get away totally scot-free when it comes to tales of queer criminality).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3383/3264953298_3af468a046_o.gif" alt="thecount" align="right" height="387" width="198" />Girls were dazzled, and the white way was brightened, with the arrival of dapper nobleman Count Jean de Marquette. His dash and vivacity made for a meteoric cafÃ© career, which has come crashing down in Justice Brownâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s court, December 10, 1915.</p>
<p>Mrs. Helen Roberts, Miss Eva Knoll, and Mrs. M. Brader, of the Santa Barbara Apartments, were three of the ladies who fell under his sway.  They probably found him less dashing as they stood in court and identified various articles of jewelry, looted from their rooms in the Santa Barbara, found in de Marquetteâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s possession.</p>
<p>He also made the rounds as none other than <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0187981/" title="crispy" target="_blank">Donald Crisp</a>, and supported himself by writing ficticious checks as the actor/director.  </p>
<p>Turns out that heâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s just Leonell Gianini, a repeated youthful offender whoâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />d been <a href="https://1947project.com/esmeralda" title="senttowhittier" target="_blank">sent to Whittier</a> for burglary.  His folks are ranch owners with a farm out in Ocean Park Heights (renamed Mar Vista in 1924).  Nevertheless, in court, he claimed the jewelry as heirlooms â€œfrom his ancient and honorable familyâ€ in France.  He got five years at Folsom. </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3401/3264128199_1126a5329c_o.gif" alt="santabarbarathesoapopera" height="89" width="474" /></p>

Hand over the money or there will be a tragedy.â€</p>
<p>At his trial, Pfeiffer denied contemplating a bank robbery.  â€œI am a somnabulist,â€ he explained.  â€œOn the morning in particular, I walked in my sleep and went over to the table to write this note, which was found by the detectives when they called several hours later.  It was all a dream.  I dreamed that I had held up a bank.â€  Deputy City Prosecutor Ford Q. Jack, reminding the court that in several recent hold-ups the same method had been employed, asked that to curb the dream alibi in prospective bank robbers, Pfeiffer be given the maximum sentence.  Pfeiffer was then sentenced to 180 days in the City Jail to think up new uses for chemistry.</p>

<p>
Of course, deep within the libraryâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s quietude, one couldnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t hear the bulldozers rumbling.  Surely through the 50s they knew which way the wind blew, and it blew some silent but foul CRA halitosis through the cracks in the early 60s.  By 1964 the Society was given notice, and eventually some blood money for the building and expenses incurred for moving and storage.  In November 1968 the Society had moved out the last of their collection; shortly thereafter the bulldozers were deafening.  The latticed windows and oak flooring and everything Independence Hall went crack and crumble.</p>
<p>Today, the <a href="https://forum.skyscraperpage.com/showthread.php?t=154492" title="towerofhope" target="_blank">Citigroup Tower </a>(AC Martin Partners, 1979) sits atop the Hope Street site.  </p>
<p>The library took everything and moved into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granada_Shoppes_and_Studios" title="granadaSS" target="_blank">Granada Shoppes and Studios</a>, where they remained until 1971.  Unlike anything on Bunker Hill, the Lafayette Park area was left in blithe poverty long enough to allow <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/granadashopperstudiosbuilding/" title="gsandstuds" target="_blank">this building</a> to survive and become an HCM (read about #238 on <a href="https://bigorangelandmarks.blogspot.com/" title="bigorange" target="_blank">BOL</a> in a few weeks) and eventually National Register.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm1.static.flickr.com/248/3264130047_78477974f9_o.gif" alt="granshoppes" height="290" width="479" /></p>

<p>
From there they hunted around and these Colonial folk found another Colonial buildingâ€¦though again, Spanish Colonial.  Built as the Glendale Chamber of Commerce Building in 1929, 600 South Central Avenueâ€”all 4,300 square feet of itâ€”proved the perfect space, especially after the Society filled it with Windsor chairs, gas lamps and (American) Colonial flags.</p>

The two collared ringleaders were on their way to the station house when one of the youngsters tucked a lock of long hair under his capâ€¦he being Miss Juanita Stuart, fourteen, of the Rossmere.  She protested tearfully when her mother was instructed by officers to burn the costume of khaki trousers, flannel shirt and boyâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s sweater, and to keep the young lady attired in feminine apparel only thereafter.</p>
<p><b>July 1, 1927.</b>  William Barrett, Rossmerian, had been arrested at the hotel by officers on Volstead violations and entered into evidence was one large bottle of gin.  At Barrettâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s trial the prosecuting attorney sought to clinch a conviction by producing said bottle, but, like a reversed wedding at Cana, a police property room at LAPD will turn gin into water.  </p>

<p>Barrett went back to the Rossmere a free man, thankful to the police for working a miracle.</p>

Bitters, 82, a former shoplifter by trade, decided on September 5 of this year to stop eating.  The fourteen-year resident of the Rossmere simply found life â€œno longer worth living,â€ which is reasonable enough (moreover recently-assassinated Gandhi had made fasting fashionable).  But Bitters was descended upon by members of the Community Chest and the Salvation Armyâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Golden Agers Club, who bundled him up and trundled him off to General Hosptial for psychiatric examination.  </p>

Elena Bravo had warned her little Martha, seven, against playing on the third floor fire escape, but Martha didnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t listen and tumbled off, only to be caught by Mrs. Max Casadosâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ground-floor clothesline.

Morales, 28, delivered a benediction of blood to six of his sleeping children.  And after his sprinkler-like artery-opening anointing act, he beat down a door and chased his wifeâ€”she carrying their nine-month-old babyâ€”and her parents into the street outside the Rossmere with a butcher knife.  When the cops finally arrived at First and Hope they found Morales inside, having slashed his throat with a razor blade.  He was taken to the prison ward at General Hospital.</p>

The Hot L Baltimore of its day.  Of its dope-addled, nudie pinup, shotgun-toting Postwar day.  Letâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s meet some of them now.</p>

Our first resident of the Elmar, Ex-Cpl. Roy (Peewee) Lewis, 23, formerly of Joliet, Ill, is one of those war vets who came to Los Angeles.  Los Angeles, the promise of the good life.  You could become anyone.  Your face could be up on the big screen!  Plastered on billboards!  Peewee at least got his plastered all over the corner of <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=James+M+Wood+Blvd+%26+Fedora+St,+Los+Angeles,+CA&amp;sll=34.056802,-118.297606&amp;sspn=0.009031,0.014591&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=34.056802,-118.297606&amp;spn=0.009031,0.014591&amp;t=h&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr" title="lewislosthishead" target="_blank">Ninth and Fedora</a>.</p>
<p>Lewis and his pal Paul Allen, 19, of 647 West 98th Street, were up in San Francisco a while back, where they managed to boost sixteen machine guns from the <a href="https://www.sfarmory.com/history.php" title="armory" target="_blank">San Francisco</a> <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/01/13/BAG0INI8PD1.DTL" title="kink" target="_blank">Armory</a>.  Back in Los Angeles, they went on a taxi driver-robbing crime spree.  Then they came upon an unusually hard piece of luck.  While motoring along they espied a man whoâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />d just parked, drove by and gave him the eye a couple more timesâ€¦this tickled the cop-sense of the carâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s occupant, Det. Sgt. Elmer V. Jackson, of administrative vice squad.  He drew his pistol and held it under his coat.</p>
<p>Lewis approached, leveling a paratrooperâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s machine gun at Jackson.  â€œIâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />ll take thatâ€ were Lewisâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> last words, for though he was referring to Jacksonâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s wallet, Jackson pushed the door open, knocking the machine gun aside, and Lewis took a service revolver blast to the face.  Allen burned rubber and Jackson emptied his gun at the fleeing car.<br />
<img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3157/2514463350_1c7e918cc6_o.gif" alt="csa" height="93" width="400" /><br />
Police found an Elmar Hotel room key on Lewisâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> body and they lit out for Hope Street, just in time to catch Allen leaving with his arms full of clothing.  Allenâ€”whose upper arm was grazed by one of Jacksonâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s bulletsâ€”said Lewis had persuaded him to commit the holdups after meeting him in a bar, and Allen had agreed since he needed the money to marry a 17 year-old girl. So much for their next planned venture, which was knocking over a store at Slauson and Vermont.<br />
<b><br />
November 14, 1947</b>.   Edna Grover, a raven-haired 20 year-old model, calls the Elmar home.  But it was at the home of photographer William Kemp, 1830 Redesdale Avenue, where investigators from the DAâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s office found over 1,000 lewd photos of Edna.  Kemp was fined $350 ($3,678 current USD) and given a 180-day suspended jail sentence, while our Elmarette was granted probation for her provocative posing.</p>

Martin Salas, 23, left the Elmarâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s confines for an early morning <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;saddr=S+Main+St+%26+E+5th+St,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90013&amp;daddr=W+6th+St+at+Spring+St,+90013+to:W+3rd+St+%26+S+Spring,+90013+to:W+2nd+St+%26+S+Spring,+Los+Angeles,+Ca+to:W+3rd+St+%26+Figueroa,+Los+Angeles,+CA&amp;mra=pi&amp;mrcr=3&amp;sll=34.047735,-118.249412&amp;sspn=0.009032,0.014591&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=34.051664,-118.250999&amp;spn=0.018063,0.029182&amp;z=15" title="wildride" target="_blank">spin</a> this day.  At Fifth and Main he hit a truck and injured the driver; he had an argument over right-of-way with a parked car at Sixth and Spring, and another wouldnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t get out of the way at Third and Spring, and he had a metallic argument with another parked car at Second and Spring.  Undaunted, he piloted smack dab into an RKO movie shoot at Third and Figueroa (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0045205/" title="sf" target="_blank"><i>Sudden Fear</i></a>?  <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0044417/" title="bml" target="_blank"><i>Beware, My Lovely</i></a>?) where a motorist thatâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />d tailed him flagged down a cop.  The officer jerked open Salasâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> door, only to have Salas step on the gas, forcing the cop to run alongside until enough cops tackled the car and forced it to stop.  At some point during Mr. Salasâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> wild ride heâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />d had a passenger who ditched in an awful (in every sense of the word) hurryâ€”hair was found on the windshield of the passenger side.  Salas was booked on felony hit-and-run.</p>
<p><b>March 4, 1953</b>.  Jack Hodges is 26, an unemployed aircraft worker, and lives a stoneâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s throw from the top of Angels Flight at 314 South Olive.  His pal Dean Coleman, 22, is in school to learn <a href="https://www.smcelectronics.com/tvrep.htm" title="imakemoneyinmysparetime" target="_blank">television repair</a>, and bunks at the Elmar.  When Coleman isnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t in school, the two of them visit the local hotels.  With their signature sawed-off shotgun and a briefcase.  The only robbery Coleman didnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t accompany Hodges on, of course, was the time Hodges robbed the night clerk of the Elmar.  </p>
<p>Colemanâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s money wore thin and heâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />d pawned his television repair apparatuses, and went shotgun-brandishing to get the stuff out of hock.  Unfortunately for Coleman, Hodges pawned a stolen wristwatch, which led police to an old mugshot of Hodges; a little police work later and Hodges was caught in a bar at Sixth and Hill, his sawed-off shotgun and briefcase found in his Olive St. hotel room closet.    He gave up Coleman, who was arrested while watching television in the lobby of 235 S. Hope.<br />

Coleman, who studied dramatics before his decision to become a television repair man, was never meant to be a shotgun-wielding, hotel-clerk robbing gunman in real life.  â€œAs you see I donâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t appear to be a tough guy,â€ said Coleman, â€œbut I can act the part when the occasion warrants.â€</p>
<p>
<b><br />
July 22, 1956</b>.   Elmar resident Frank Swope, 33, took offense at fellow Bunker Hiller Harold J. McAnally, 57â€”McAnally lived one block west at 230 South Flowerâ€”buying a lady a drink one summer day in a bar at 822 West Third Street.  So Swope walked up and pushed McAnally from his stool, whereupon McAnally landed head-first on the concrete floor.  A few hours after McAnally died from his skull fracture, Swope surrendered to authorities at the Elmar.</p>

<p><b><br />
February 7, 1957</b>.  LAPD went to investigate a disturbance in a bar at 731 West Third and there arrested â€œAllan Ayers,â€ 32, a resident of the Elmar&#8230;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3165/2515043102_d57d7d7d3a_o.gif" alt="gerberbaby" height="118" width="198" /></p>
<p>&#8230;turns out our Elmaree was in reality August Gerbitz, two years on the lam from a double murder rap in Evansville, where in December 1954 he gunned down his girlfriend, Mrs. Nadine Martin, 21, and one George Temme, 38.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2028/2515043124_03c0266703_o.gif" alt="jimfix" align="right" height="178" width="198" /><b><br />
March 20, 1957</b>.  Salvador Perez and Jesus Cruz, both 27, had been popped by narco and were up on the fourth floor of Police Administration, having been photographed at the lab.  They were walked into the hallway by officers Hernandez and Ruddell to be cuffed and led to the first-floor Central Jail for booking.</p>
<p>Thatâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s when both of them made a break for it.  Cruz, of 4923 Gratian Street, was tackled by Ruddell right out of the gate.  Perez, he of 235 South Hope, dashed down the stairway.  Officer Hernandez slipped and fell, broke his ankle, but continued to give chase nevertheless.  Perez ran down to the ground level and made a wrong turn toward Central Jail, turned and ran past Hernandez, but unfortunately, into the arms of Lt. Arroyo.  Another vacancy at the Elmar as Perez (and his buddy Cruz) are booked by an out-of-breath, broken-ankled cop on felony violation of the State Narcotics Act.</p>

Perhaps you too can soak up enough of its magic to place you on this honored roll.</p>
<p>Alas, the City has wiped Hope clean, and thereafter had it thoroughly disinfected, as one would to so much egesta on a cracked tile floor.  They have left us with the most barely readable of palimpsests.  Letâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s take a look.</p>
<p>Hope Street had two levels between Second and Third; here, we are looking north toward Second, standing above the west end of the Third Street tunnel.  The Elmar was midway along the block.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2288/2507367418_beb0fc24b4_o.gif" alt="ElmarToday" height="279" width="575" />Today, the bilevel nature of Hope Street is five decades gone.  The Ghost Elmar floats roughly above an intersection made by a new street, named after a Lithuanian-Ruthenian <a href="https://www.ruf.rice.edu/~sarmatia/100/thompson.html" title="Kosciuszko" target="_blank">nobleman-turned-revolutionary</a>.  I betcha Frank Swope or Edna Grover never woulda guessed.</p>
<p>The City doesn&#8217;t screw around when they want something bad enough.  They&#8217;ll move mountains, quite literally, to which these images taken across from the Elmar (looking south down Hope toward the library) attest:</p>

<p>The Elmar, gone, but perhaps now a bit less forgotten.  For this blog is a little like the Elmar itself.  Like it says on the cigarette pack.  Wherever particular people congregate.</p>
