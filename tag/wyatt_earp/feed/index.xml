										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-824" title="" src="../wp-content/uploads/2015/09/wyatttEarp-208x300.gif" alt="wyatttEarp" width="208" height="300" /></p>
<p>Dodge City. Tombstone. The OK Corral.Â  Wyatt Earp will also be remembered as a guy who ran a piece of two-bit flimflam on Bunco Hill. And got popped for itâ€”but then, this was no 1880s gambling saloon. This was the grandest new hotel in Taft-era Los Angeles. Perhaps Earp was a little out of his element.</p>
<p>After the turn of the century, Earp was based out of Los Angeles, trying his hand at the kind of gambling grown-ups doâ€”oil exploration, mining ventures, real estateâ€”with considerable less success than heâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />d had at the card table. Occasionally heâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />d work with LAPD on outside-jurisdiction work, like chasing fugitives into Mexico, but inveterate gambler Earpâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s core motivation remained gambling. This would on occasion put lawman Earp on the wrong side of the straight and narrowâ€”e.g., his refereeing of the Fitzsimmons-Sharkey boxing match of â€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />96, generally regarded to be fixed. And when Earp and his con-rades would set up their fleece outfit, where else would they go but that anchor of Bunker Hill, the brand-new Auditorium Hotel?</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-823" src="../wp-content/uploads/2015/09/petersonRealEstate-220x300.gif" alt="petersonRealEstate" width="220" height="300" /><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-821" src="../wp-content/uploads/2015/09/headlineSharperCallsCops-300x132.jpg" alt="headlineSharperCallsCops" width="300" height="132" srcset="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/headlineSharperCallsCops-300x132.jpg 300w, https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/headlineSharperCallsCops-475x209.jpg 475w, https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/headlineSharperCallsCops.jpg 575w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 85vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>The Auditorium had been open a scant six months when on July 21, 1911, a J. Y. Peterson sat down for game of <a title="allsfaroincardsandwar" href="//www.lahacal.org/gentleman/faro.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">faro</a> with three sharpers from San Franciscoâ€”W. W. Stap, Waller Scott, and E. Dunn. But all would not go as planned.</p>
<p>Seems that Petersonâ€”a real estate agent with an office at 407 Stimson Buildingâ€”got hinkey at the trioâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s far-out tale that they were sore at their SF syndicate, and wanted to stiff their own backers by rigging the game to let Peterson win big. Peterson would thus play the rigged gameâ€”pinpricked odd cards, the dealer placing a finger on the table when an even card was to showâ€”in front of others, and make a hefty profit on the $2,500 ($54,985 USD2007) heâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />d invest at the outset in chips. Realizing he had nothing to lose except his roll, he called in the coppers.</p>
<p>Stap, Scott, and card-dealer Dunn engaged club rooms 425-426 at the Auditorium, installed their faro bank outfit and all kindred paraphernalia, and were ready to get down to the business of swindling Petersonâ€”who was further tipped off to that fishy smell in Denmark as there were no other players presentâ€”when Johnny Law busted in.</p>
<p>Down at the station-house, the W. W. Stap who inveigled Peterson into buy into a fixed bank game turned out to be none other than Wyatt Earp. Released from City Jail on $500 bond, Earpâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s explanation was that it was purely accidental that he should be there during the raid. The police, in their infinite wisdom, elected to bust into the room before any gambling actually begun, which sank the conspiracy to defraud charge; the courts couldnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t make a vagrancy charge stick, either.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-822" src="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/itJustHappenedBuncoExplanation-150x150.gif" alt="itJustHappenedBuncoExplanation" width="150" height="150" />In the end, the City Prosecutor decided there wasnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t enough evidence against Earp. Waller Scott pleaded guilty and demanded a jury trial, but the City Prosecutor â€œdidnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t have the timeâ€ to take it up and let the whole thing drop. Dunn, aka Harry Dean, pleaded guilty and was given a six month sentence, suspended, on condition that he leave the city. And so <a title="offyago" href="https://www.wyattsearp.com/history12.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wyatt Earp</a> went on his six-shooterinâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> way: he hung around Hollywood and hit up William S. Hart to publicize his life. That never happened, ended up dying down on <a title="wipedawaybychildren" href="https://www.greatschools.net/school/rating.page?id=2258&amp;state=CA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">17th Street</a>, and was buried in a <a title="thatsfunnyhedoesntlookit" href="https://www.ajhs.org/publications/chapters/chapter.cfm?documentID=279" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jewish cemetery</a> in 1929.</p>
<p><em>Finest New Hotel in Modern Christendom</em></p>
<p>â€œIt will command a view of perennial green, unsurpassed in the heart of any great city!â€</p>
<p>What <em>was</em> this this hotbed of vice, the Auditorium Hotel? Only the finest new hotel in Christendom, mister. (â€œIt will command a view of perennial green, unsurpassed in the heart of any great city!â€)</p>
<p><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2015/09/auditoriumHotel.gif"><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-834" src="../wp-content/uploads/2015/09/auditoriumHotel-300x182.gif" alt="auditoriumHotel" width="300" height="182" srcset="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/auditoriumHotel-300x182.gif 300w, https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/auditoriumHotel-475x288.gif 475w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 85vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>It all began with the northwest corner of Fifth and Olive, facing Central Park. (I know, the purist in you wants to object that weâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />re not technically <em>on</em> Bunker Hill. Well, think of the Auditorium Hotel as our landmark edge to the south. The Jaffa Gate, if you will. Angels Flight is the Dung Gate and weâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />ll call the <a title="Damascusgate" href="../TheMonarch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monarch Hotel</a> Damascus Gate while weâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />re at it. Naturally youâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />re continuing to argue that the Edison Building makes a better Jaffa Gate than the Auditorium Hotel. Well, you would say that.)</p>
<p><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2015/09/auditoriumAddOn.gif"><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-832" src="../wp-content/uploads/2015/09/auditoriumAddOn-300x154.gif" alt="auditoriumAddOn" width="300" height="154" /></a></p>
<p>Auditorium architect Otto <a title="Keannu" href="https://flickr.com/photos/12576329@N04/1306901921/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neher</a>, with partner Chauncey Fitch <a title="madskillz" href="https://www.you-are-here.com/building/lincoln_heights.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Skilling</a>, produced the New Auditorium Hotel, designed in what the papers for lack of a better term called the â€œModern Classicâ€ style. It was 60&#215;162â€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />, faced with light-colored granite, the lobbies lavished in marble, mahogany and mosaic tile. The six floors of 150 rooms are paneled in birch.<br />
<img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3041/3014282449_247b29640b_o.gif" alt="rendering" width="575" height="359" /></p>
<p>A look up Oliveâ€”the three biggest buildings behind the Auditorium are the <a title="trenton" href="../hoteltrenton" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trenton</a>, the <a title="free" href="../fremont" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fremont</a>, and the Palace Hotel:</p>
<p><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2015/09/viewUpOliveAuditorium.gif"><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-835" src="../wp-content/uploads/2015/09/viewUpOliveAuditorium-300x266.gif" alt="viewUpOliveAuditorium" width="300" height="266" srcset="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/viewUpOliveAuditorium-300x266.gif 300w, https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/viewUpOliveAuditorium-475x422.gif 475w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 85vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>The Auditorium is leased by Bernard Frank Green and his mother, Mrs. Mary Sells Green; in 1919 M. Drake Perry takes over the lease and buys the hotel from R. D. Wade in 1921. He puts in a grill room and makes another $100,000 in improvements. But the shock of the Biltmore Hotel being built on the opposite corner apparently killed Perry, and Probate Court sold the Auditorium Hotel to George Roos.</p>
<p>(The Biltmore to the left; the 1924 Pacific Telephone and Telegraph Company Mutual Exchange is under construction. The Deaconess/Clara Barton Hospital between the Methodist church and the new telephone building doesn&#8217;t have many days left before conversion to an auto park.)<img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-830" src="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/5thOliveRemodel-150x150.gif" alt="5thOliveRemodel" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/5thOliveRemodel-150x150.gif 150w, https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/5thOliveRemodel-160x160.gif 160w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 85vw, 150px" /></p>
<p>Roos (vintage clothing collectors out there certainly know the Roos Bros. labelâ€”George was one of those Rooses) eventually sells to Charles Harris, who held the lease and ran the hotel through the 20s.</p>
<p>Itâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s an exciting time: everyoneâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s abuzz about the sale of the California Club at Fifth and Hill to the <a title="loftsforsalegetyourloftsforsale" href="https://titleguaranteebuilding.com/history.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Title Guarantee and Trust Company</a>, and the forthcoming home of <a title="nicemurals" href="https://www.glasssteelandstone.com/BuildingDetail/3611.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">California Edison</a> at Fifth and Grand. Harris refurnishes 100 rooms and renames the Auditorium the San Carlos in January 1929. Why? Because at that point he was spending most of his time in Phoenix, directing the opening of his mighty <a title="SC2" href="https://www.historichotels.org/hotel/Hotel_San_Carlos/629" target="_blank" rel="noopener">San Carlos there</a>. Just as there were once matching Auditoria, there were now Sister San Carloses. Charles Harris in 1931 departs the Phoenix San Carlos for yet his <a title="SC3" href="https://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/tf8x0nb4gb/?docId=tf8x0nb4gb&amp;brand=calisphere&amp;layout=printable" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>third</em> San Carlos</a>, this one in <a title="nowfortheelderly" href="https://www.waymarking.com/gallery/image.aspx?f=1&amp;guid=e57de009-0f91-4658-838c-64cbc7c53790&amp;gid=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yuma</a>. He eventually sells his Los Angeles SC in toto to G. G. Joyce, owner of the Hazlewood restaurant chain in Portland.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-829" title="" src="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/5thOliveGoogies-300x280.gif" alt="5thOliveGoogies" width="300" height="280" /></p>
<p>Here, in this mid-30s image, check out the San Carlos neon blade affixed to the wedding cake that is the former Auditorium:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-837" src="../wp-content/uploads/2015/09/sanCarlosSouth1930.gif" alt="sanCarlosSouth1930" width="379" height="514" /></p>
<p>The San Carlos then went through a streamlining much in the way the Auditorium did:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-838" src="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/hazards1920.gif" alt="hazards1920" width="250" height="158" /></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-839" src="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/hazards1935.gif" alt="hazards1935" width="250" height="181" /></p>
<p>Now we all know that the redoubtable Claud Beelman was the architect-at-helm for the 1938 Philharmonic Auditorium redesign. This author is yet to discover when (and by whom) the San Carlos had its cleanlining:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-841" title="" src="../wp-content/uploads/2015/09/sanCarlosCleanedUp1940-300x250.gif" alt="sanCarlosCleanedUp1940" width="349" height="291" srcset="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/sanCarlosCleanedUp1940-300x250.gif 300w, https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/sanCarlosCleanedUp1940-475x396.gif 475w" sizes="(max-width: 349px) 85vw, 349px" /></p>
<p>The San Carlos made its way into the Modern Age, even acquiring a 1955 <a title="A&amp;D" href="https://www.laokay.com/ArmetDavisNewlove.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Armet and Davis</a> Googies:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-842" title="" src="../wp-content/uploads/2015/09/sanCarlosGoogie-300x204.gif" alt="sanCarlosGoogie" width="362" height="246" srcset="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/sanCarlosGoogie-300x204.gif 300w, https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/sanCarlosGoogie-475x323.gif 475w" sizes="(max-width: 362px) 85vw, 362px" /></p>
<p>â€¦so what became of our Jaffa Gate? Unlike most of Bunker Hill, it made it all the way through the mid-1980s. Here, you could hang at Googies and get a room at the Carlos to boot, ca. 1986; thatâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s the <a title="BMTower" href="https://www.you-are-here.com/los_angeles/biltmore.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biltmore Tower</a> going up in the background:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-843" title="" src="../wp-content/uploads/2015/09/sanCarlosGoogieAlt-300x226.gif" alt="sanCarlosGoogieAlt" width="371" height="279" srcset="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/sanCarlosGoogieAlt-300x226.gif 300w, https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/sanCarlosGoogieAlt-475x358.gif 475w" sizes="(max-width: 371px) 85vw, 371px" /></p>
<p>(But first, a map, so as to explicate the many addresses of the Auditorium/San Carlos.)</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-845" title="" src="../wp-content/uploads/2015/09/baistMapSanCarlos-300x214.gif" alt="baistMapSanCarlos" width="300" height="214" srcset="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/baistMapSanCarlos-300x214.gif 300w, https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/baistMapSanCarlos-475x340.gif 475w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 85vw, 300px" /></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-846" src="../wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bookieRaids.gif" alt="bookieRaids" width="200" height="196" />William Friedland was a cigar store clerk at one of the San Carlosâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s sidewalk shops. At least he was until February of 1939, when he got popped for making book therein. The establishment at 513 West Fifth had been raided many times for horserace betting, and in November 1940 Friedland had to go before the LA County Grand Jury to dish the dirt on a crooked horserace racket. He was grilled by none other than Jerry Gielsler, chairman of the Horse Racing Board, who disclosed the racing scandal. Swirled into the mix of our tobaccoshop/bookstore at the San Carlos were bribe-taking jockeys and horse owners, as well as local sharpies Benny Chapman, I. W. Kivel, aka Doc Kebo; Bernard Einstoss, alias Barney Mooney; and Saul â€œSonnyâ€ Greenberg. Mooney and Kebo gave horse owner Irving Sangbusch (alias James J. Murphy) over $20,000 to bribe jockeys at Hollywood Park in 1939; by the end of 1940 the take was up to $180,000 on a single race.</p>

He asserted that the clicking of chips and rattle of dice could be heard from 511 West Fifth as early as 1925 (he remembered the date because that was about the time habituÃ©-of-the-place Eddie Eagen was shot there in a holdup). Selby said that when 513 was in operation, he could hear loud-speakers announcing race results in the garage. When asked if it was loud enough for a policeman on the street to hear it: â€œOh,â€ said Selby, â€œthey all knew about it.â€</p>

Apparently Mooney enlisted his pal <a title="GR" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWdX0S2OoZg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">George Raft</a> to have a friendly discussion with Ameche about the subject.</p>
<p>Of five defendants, only Bernard Mooney got nickedâ€”for contributing the delinquency of minors. Minor jockeys, which legally should cancel itself out. Some $1,000 fines were assessed, but then, thatâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s what these fellows spent on shoes in a month.

<p>Royse was finally nabbed in the act with his fifteen-year-old nephew in tow, pilfering typewriters from the Auditoriumâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s shop on the corner of Fifth and Olive.

<p>The early morning of Dec 21, 1924 saw a the arrival of the â€œvariety bandits.â€ Two men hit the Moon Drug Store at 3526 West Washington, forcing the soda clerk into the closet and making off with $200; they hit the Barnett Drug Store at 3723 South Vermont, where they locked up two women and emptied the register of $75 (during which time a customer entered; one of the bandits took off his cap and waited on the gent, selling him a magazine and pocketing the proceeds); they hit the Zenith Drug Store at 4929 Moneta, and made off with $60; and when they then hit Harry Spoonerâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s drug store at 4493 Beverly Blvd, they got $30 and eight pints of whiskey. Maybe it was the whiskey. Maybe it was getting late. Maybe it was just time for their luck to change. Because things didnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t go so well at the Auditorium Hotel.</p>
<p>Just before dawn, these two heavily armed gents muscled night clerk J. C. Evans into the back to open the safe. Though threatened with instant death, Evans claimed he didnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t have the combination. As the two holdup men argued, Evans slipped away, and the bandits took right after him. Unfortunately for them, Evans had a good knowledge of the many doorways and halls of the lower floor, and got a good lead on them, long enough to turn, produce his own hand cannon, and open fire. The robbers, one of them apparently hit, had to make it out of the hotel in a mad dash and into their touring car and speed away into the first morning light, never to be heard from again.</p>

<p>August 14, 1927 was a red-letter day for crime in Los Angeles: armed men stole $2,000 in cash and jewelry, and a $1,500 car, from a auto dealership at 1355 South Main; two men were beaten and robbed by a gang of thugs at West Tenth St. near Georgia; two men in an automobile drove up alongsideâ€”a reverend, no lessâ€”Rev. Joseph Curran at Eightieth and Moneta, and robbed him without even getting out of their car.</p>

<p>Lastly, later that night, three gunmen showed up at the auto rental concern in the Auditorium Hotel to relieve manager D. C. Huff of $85 ($1,007 USD2007).</p>
<p>Reprobate gaming came back into fashion at the San Carlos in 1948â€¦in the form of pinball. In March of 1948 nine men were arrested by the administrative vice squad for owning these marble contraptions, in flagrant violation of the Cityâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s antipinball ordinance. Asst. City Atty. Donald Redwine, however, doubts the arrests should have been made until someone comes up with a â€œclear-cut decisionâ€ on the legality of these newfangled games. Of course, <a title="pinhist" href="https://marvin3m.com/gtb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pinball</a> isnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t exactly <em>new</em>, but if thereâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s one thing 1947 gave us itâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s a pinball machine that (distributors claim) is a <a title="histoierpinball" href="https://www.bmigaming.com/pinballhistory.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">â€œgame of science and skill.â€</a> That notwithstanding, one LaVerne Murphy is cooling his heels in the tank after vice squad raiders came down on his newfangled â€œflipperedâ€ machine in the San Carlos.

Purcell, 50, a woman of wealth and taste, had come from Chicago to buy a lot and build a home in sunny Los Angeles. For two years she lived in the Auditorium Hotel, well-liked and highly sought after for social and cultural gatherings. And yet, her father having died of cancer, she believed, rightly or wrongly, that it was going to get her too, and drank a phial of carbolic acid in her room.</p>
<p>February 1940, insurance man Jesse Edward Patty, 47, left his home at 1227 S. Plymouth Blvd. and checked into the San Carlos with murderous intent. Self-murderous. Several letters to his wife and friends later, he took poison. <img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-866" src="../wp-content/uploads/2015/09/insuranceSalesman.gif" alt="insuranceSalesman" width="278" height="110" /></p>
<p>L. D. Roberts, a 50-year-old lumber man, left his home at 7024 Mission Place in Huntington Park, July 1942, to check into the San Carlos. Roberts had problems, but brought with him a traditional problem-solver, the .32 automatic.<img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-867" src="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/lumber.gif" alt="lumber" width="256" height="85" /></p>

It was Sept. 3, 1941, and Joe had had enough of the San Carlos. He wanted to come home to their house at 1314 Sunset Blvd. He wanted a reconciliation. Always bring a gun to a reconciliation.</p>
<p>Rafaelaâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s kids from a previous marriage were homeâ€”Rosie, 24, Lydia, 20, Mario, 16, and Carmen Uriarte, 14. Mom and â€œdadâ€ hadnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t been talking long when they heard the shot. Joe came out firing, the girls fled, Carmen took one through the knee and Lydia through the shoulder before Joe was tackled by Mario. Gutierrez shoved the gun into Marioâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s side and pulled the trigger, but the gun was empty. Mario kicked dad out the back door. Gutierrez reloaded his .25, and gave himself the same treatment he gave mom: one to the head.</p>
<p>And lest we forget â€œMiss Dale Erwin, 22, of Trenton, NJâ€ who checked into the San Carlos in August of 1946 and promptly leaptâ€”or fellâ€”from her window.

<p>One is Frederick Jordan, vice-president of the Entomological Society of England. The esteemed zoologist, whose soul is one with butterflies and moths and whose body is dedicated to the netting of terebrant hymenopteraeâ€”those that fly, of courseâ€”is a welcome additon to the Auditorium. But not as a guest. Heâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s the night porter<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-877" title="" src="../wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bushel.gif" alt="bushel" width="255" height="245" />.</p>
<p>Seems his English doctor told him to get some sun, and not work too hard. Despite the lateness of the seasonâ€”October, 1911â€”Jordan found Los Angeles choked with butterflies, especially the Spring Beauty, the Holly Blue, the Zebra Swallowtail, the Checkered Skipper, the Brown Argus, the Clifden Nonpareil, the Tortoiseshell, the Mother Shipton and the Duke of Burgundy Fritillary. Thatâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s great Jordan, now get back to work.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-888" src="../wp-content/uploads/2015/09/oldFriends.gif" alt="oldFriends" width="250" height="235" />In the vein of any grand hotel (or, say, <a title="GH" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Ed8WddJ1g" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Grand Hotel</em></a>), the Auditorium lobby was always full of great excitement, chance meetings, tearful partings, tearful reunions. Such was the case when Dr. D. A. Gildersleeve of Richmond was in town for a 1911 AMA conference to deliver the stirring paper â€œHook-worm and What Has Been Done In the South Toward Its Eradicationâ€ when he was approached by none other than â€œUncle Joe,â€ who had been residing on East Ninth St. for some years. Joe, it seems, had been a Gilderslave, childhood playmate of the good doctorâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s, had been Gildersleeveâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s servant in battle in all the campaigns of Lee, but had ended up â€œdisenfranchisedâ€ after The War. Joe stayed with Gildersleeve for some years but eventually went up North; and now, some thirty-five years later, they were reunited by chance in the Auditorium. An hour of gossip followed between the two in the big chairs; when the doctor bade the older man farewell he was observed slipping him what appeared to be a roll of banknotes. In describing the meeting, the Times writer showed his considerable cultural acuityâ€”or vacuity of cultural sensitivityâ€”in any event, Iâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />m not going to transcribe it, but will here attach a clip of the encounter between what the Times describes as the â€œshambling darkyâ€ and what I imagine as a <a title="KFCracker" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwURoueDzFo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Harland Sanders</a>/<a title="mustardy" href="https://www.mauricesbbq.com/ourbbq.cfm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maurice</a> <a title="statesrights" href="https://southernpartysw.tripod.com/southernpartiesofthesouthwestssecondsite/id31.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bessinger</a>-looking <a title="starsandbarsbabes" href="https://feministlawprofs.law.sc.edu/?p=3831" target="_blank" rel="noopener">old</a> <a title="defendothegreat" href="https://www.amazon.com/Defending-My-Heritage-Maurice-Bessinger/dp/0971336903" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ofay</a>:</p>

<p>Not all sightings at the Auditorium are happy ones. Leo Julofsky was a messenger for E. D. Levinson &amp; Co., 52 Broadway, New York. He was walking down the street one dayâ€”September 19, 1919â€”with another messenger and $330,000 in Liberty bonds. On their way to Mabon &amp; Co., 45 Wall St., Julofsky handed his satchel over to the other messenger to go in and wash his hands at 71 Broadway. The other messenger waitedâ€¦and waitedâ€¦and opened the satchel. It was empty. Julofsky, and $141,000 ($1,676,761 USD2007) were gone.<img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-887" src="../wp-content/uploads/2015/09/nabbed-300x141.gif" alt="nabbed" width="300" height="141" /></p>

He met an ex-policeman named John J. Stoney in a Detroit YMCA and they began to travel together. (In answer to a question about girls, he was adamant that no girls were mixed up in the plot whatsoever. Make of that what you will.) Julofsky and Stoney were shacked up together at the Auditorium when Julofsky was nabbed in the lobby on December 27. â€œI donâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t know why I did it,â€ said the son of a retired cloak and suit maker, â€œno girls were mixed up in it and no one is to blame but myself.â€ He was given three years and change in Sing Sing. He wonâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t be alone, though, as his brother Milton and a bond dealer from the Bronx named Arthur Miller were also sent up for criminally receiving his bonds.</p>
<h3>The Lobby of Convergence:</h3>

<p>The Auditorium Hotel features itself in a roundabout way as a minor footnote in the famous 1922 Klan raid of Volstead-violating Mexicans in Inglewood, wherein a police shootout ended up in the cops shootingâ€”guess what!â€”three of their own, one fatally (the town constable), discovered only when the hoods were opened.</p>

Help! Help! Let me go, I want to see a Kleagle, I want to see a <a title="fromtheKlavern" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleagle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kleagle</a>!â€ in tones so loud it brought people out from several floors above and below. She was carried out fighting and taken to the psychopathic ward for observation. Found in her handbag? Her Auditorium Hotel room key. (FYI, the Kleagle there at the time was Nathan A. Baker, then a deputy sheriff for Los Angeles County.)<img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-882" src="../wp-content/uploads/2015/09/feegle.gif" alt="feegle" width="250" height="236" /></p>
<p>And for the last time, thatâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s <em>Kleagle</em>, not <em>Fleegle</em>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-881" src="../wp-content/uploads/2015/09/fairyTale.gif" alt="fairyTale" width="222" height="182" />February 7, 1923. P. C. Steckel, a boilermaker, and prominent in organized-labor society, was in court today, telling the judge a tearful story all about how heâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />d been awarded the Carnegie medal of honor for rescuing some child from an oncoming train. The judge took this in, told Steckel that <a title="ArabianLabor" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheherazade" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scheherazade</a> had nothing on him, but that it had precious little to do with violating the Miller-Jones narcotic law. Seems Steckel sold four ounces of morphine to a narcotics enforcement officer at the Auditorium Hotel. Nevertheless, Judge Bledsoe said that Steckel was due some consideration for possession of the medal, and gave him only two years at <a title="FedPen" href="https://www.doc.wa.gov/facilities/mcneilhistory.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McNeill Island</a> instead of the customary four.</p>
<p>Then there was the matter of Charles Harris, whom you remember as owner-operator of the Auditorium in the 20s and orchestrated its change into the San Carlos, tossing Rev. George Chalmers Richmond out on his ear. Harris entered Richmondâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s chamber on January 3, 1923, removed the pastorâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s clothes and by force of threats kept him from his room. Richmond alleged his good reputation had been damaged and sued for $15,000. We donâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t know what raised Harrisâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s ire, though we can speculate: <a title="RevGCR" href="https://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,738388,00.html?iid=digg_share" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Richmond</a> was a defrocked Episcopal rector, Bolsheviki refusenik and IWW nogoodnik, and mortal enemy of Methodist <a title="FBS" href="https://www.1947project.com/roundup" target="_blank" rel="noopener">â€œFighting Bobâ€ Shuler</a>. The Auditorium did have Methodists as neighbors, after all. (Why then he elected to rename the place San Carlos, which would vaguely reference some guy named Charles canonized by Papists, is beyond me.)<img loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-891" src="../wp-content/uploads/2015/09/sues-300x74.gif" alt="sues" width="300" height="74" /></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-880" src="../wp-content/uploads/2015/09/decipher-300x65.gif" alt="decipher" width="300" height="65" />The Auditorium was also an exhibition hall, of sorts. It was where youâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />d go in 1925 if you wanted to see, on display, <a title="biggerthanaringunfortunately" href="https://www.google.com/patents?id=2DhjAAAAEBAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=%22frank+prevost%22+1570178&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=0_1#PPA1,M1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Frank Prevostâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s decoding machine</a>. Weighing only half a pound, but with a limitless capacity for sending mechanically coded messages, it represents twelve years of study and effort. See it at the Auditorium before itâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s snapped up forever by the War Department!</p>
<p>Also, go visit <a title="bigbill" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_G._Bonelli" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bill Bonelli</a> at his (1932) HQ in the San Carlos, where heâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />ll enlist you in his cause against snooperism:</p>

<p>So what became of this wonderland of wonders, you ask?</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-883" title="" src="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/googie-300x255.gif" alt="googie" width="386" height="328" srcset="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/googie-300x255.gif 300w, https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/googie-475x403.gif 475w" sizes="(max-width: 386px) 85vw, 386px" /></p>
<p>The San Carlos crept her way into the Future, turning her back on the demolition of Bunker Hill behind.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-890" title="" src="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/sanCarlosGoodbye-300x238.gif" alt="sanCarlosGoodbye" width="379" height="301" srcset="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/sanCarlosGoodbye-300x238.gif 300w, https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/sanCarlosGoodbye-475x377.gif 475w" sizes="(max-width: 379px) 85vw, 379px" /></p>
<p>Then, in 1983, David Houck, president of Auditorium Management Co., which purchased the Philharmonic from Temple Baptist, announced demolition to make way for a new office building, hotel and residential condominiums. (Interesting management style, and it remains a parking lot.) Physicians Pharmacy, which opened in the Auditorium Office Bldng. in 1906, moved its vast pharmacy museumâ€”endless Edwardian prescription books, grinders and corkers, bottles full of arcane lotions and potionsâ€”across Olive to the San Carlos. That was a bad move: the San Carlosâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s days were numbered.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-873" src="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/1987PreDemo-300x231.gif" alt="1987PreDemo" width="300" height="231" srcset="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/1987PreDemo-300x231.gif 300w, https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/1987PreDemo-475x366.gif 475w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 85vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>Whatâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s there to tell? Somewhere around 1987 the corner was cleared. Not a word in the papers to mark its passing. Nobody cried for First German Methodist, either.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-872" src="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/1987demo-300x201.gif" alt="1987demo" width="300" height="201" srcset="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/1987demo-300x201.gif 300w, https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/1987demo-475x319.gif 475w, https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/1987demo-272x182.gif 272w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 85vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>The Southern California Gas Company thought their headquarters would be nifty there.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-874" src="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/1991-190x300.gif" alt="1991" width="190" height="300" /><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-875" src="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/1991FInish-232x300.gif" alt="1991FInish" width="232" height="300" /></p>
<p>Richard Keating of Skidmore, Owings and Merrill thought it would be cool to design the top to look like a blue flame. Which it sort of does. At least you can eat at their Blue Flame cafeteria.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-879" src="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/crown-300x253.gif" alt="crown" width="300" height="253" /></p>
<p>Why its crown does not light up blue at night is a mystery to all.</p>
<p>In any event, it is finished in 1991.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-878" src="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/closingShot-150x300.gif" alt="closingShot" width="150" height="300" /></p>
<p>That then is the tale of the Auditorium/San Carlos Hotel.</p>
<p>Walk in the Gas Co. tower sometime and ask for the Wyatt Earp suite, you&#8217;re late for the faro game.</p>
