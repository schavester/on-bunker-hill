Mrs. Emma Rupe was fixated on <i>being</i> a mother.  So much so that on July 5, 1936, the Denver waitress took a fancy to John, the two year-old son of Mr. and Mrs. John Richard O’Brien.  John, it seems, looked just like Emma’s own toddler who’d died nine years previous.  On the pretext that she was going to take the little darling out to buy him a playsuit (the O’Briens being trusting souls, and near penniless, so how could they refuse?) Emma thereupon took John shopping…as far from Denver as she could get, and with as great a chance of disappearing as possible.  Because clichés are born of truth, noir clichés especially, she beelined straight for Los Angeles, Bunker Hill specifically, and checked into the St. Regis.</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3219/2766223037_04a8b1ba4e_o.gif" alt="EmmaAndSon" height="500" width="446"></p>
<p>
For ten weeks the FBI combed the States until they were tipped off by an acquaintance of Emma’s, and on September 19 the Feds descended on 237 South Flower.  Emma, 30, was pulled from the St. Regis hysterical and weeping; the boy, whom she called “Jackie,”&#157; appeared impassive.  Emma Rupe broke down again when a Denver jury gave her twenty to life.</p>

<p>The 38-apartment St. Regis opens at the end of 1904.</p>

Much in the way a French Renaissance building might be dubbed the Sherwood, this Missionesque structure is named after a French nobleman—<a href="https://content.stregis.org/parish/templates/info.aspx?articleid=892&amp;zoneid=73" title="theReg" target="_blank">J. F. Regis</a>, tireless converter of Huguenots, and advocate of lacemaking for wayward girls.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The St. Regis leads a fairly quiet life.  Other than the aforementioned FBI intrusion in 1936, there was the small matter of the coppers showing up to collect Elmer Hudson, 32, and his wife Betty, 20, in 1928.  When two bad guys held up a café at <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=200+N+Dillon+St,+Los+Angeles,+Los+Angeles,+California+90057,+United+States&amp;sll=34.075039,-118.283315&amp;sspn=0.008727,0.013819&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;cd=1&amp;layer=c&amp;ll=34.078096,-118.281426&amp;spn=0.008726,0.013819&amp;z=16&amp;cbll=34.07374,-118.28216&amp;panoid=S1CP8ye7XYSpRibTsQ-_iQ" title="wink" target="_blank">200 Dillon Street</a> and made off with $300 ($3,554 USD2007), Betty made the mistake of not keeping her bad-guy self in the shadows.  Café owner C. V. Anderson recognized her as a former waitress.</p>
<p>What is it about these wayward gals—waitresses both—that can’t keep their clutchy paws off money nor baby?  Maybe they’ll learn some lacemaking in the pen.  Make St. Regis proud.</p>
<p></p>

The Bozwell Apartments (which seem to shoot for Greek Revival but, oddly, come off as Monterrey) next door at 245, abandoned, burn on May 22, 1962.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3050/2766358639_4947e4869e_o.gif" alt="boznotwell" height="318" width="351"></p>

<p>The blaze, reported the Times, was believed to have been “touched off by hobos.”&#157;</p>
<p>While firemen kept the conflagration from spreading to the St. Regis, its days were just as numbered as if it were the Bozwell itself.</p>
<p>For these were heady days:  the Lesser Festivals of Abandoment, The Princial Feasts of Official Neglect, and the Commemorations of Escalating Mysterious Fires.  Obligatory for the observant.</p>

		<p>There was a place, once, a place people called home—the Hotel Elmar.  Not much of a place, 230 rooms, built in 1926, facing a retaining wall, small matter of a 1953 shotgun holdup you’ll read about, sure—but you see, it was the <i>people</i> that made the Hotel Elmar what it was.  The Hot L Baltimore of its day.  Of its dope-addled, nudie pinup, shotgun-toting Postwar day.  Let’s meet some of them now.</p>

Peewee at least got his plastered all over the corner of <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=James+M+Wood+Blvd+%26+Fedora+St,+Los+Angeles,+CA&amp;sll=34.056802,-118.297606&amp;sspn=0.009031,0.014591&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=34.056802,-118.297606&amp;spn=0.009031,0.014591&amp;t=h&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr" title="lewislosthishead" target="_blank">Ninth and Fedora</a>.</p>
<p>Lewis and his pal Paul Allen, 19, of 647 West 98th Street, were up in San Francisco a while back, where they managed to boost sixteen machine guns from the <a href="https://www.sfarmory.com/history.php" title="armory" target="_blank">San Francisco</a> <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/01/13/BAG0INI8PD1.DTL" title="kink" target="_blank">Armory</a>.  Back in Los Angeles, they went on a taxi driver-robbing crime spree.  Then they came upon an unusually hard piece of luck.  While motoring along they espied a man who’d just parked, drove by and gave him the eye a couple more times…this tickled the cop-sense of the car’s occupant, Det. Sgt. Elmer V. Jackson, of administrative vice squad.  He drew his pistol and held it under his coat.</p>
<p>Lewis approached, leveling a paratrooper’s machine gun at Jackson.  “I’ll take that”&#157; were Lewis’ last words, for though he was referring to Jackson’s wallet, Jackson pushed the door open, knocking the machine gun aside, and Lewis took a service revolver blast to the face.  Allen burned rubber and Jackson emptied his gun at the fleeing car.<br>

Police found an Elmar Hotel room key on Lewis’ body and they lit out for Hope Street, just in time to catch Allen leaving with his arms full of clothing.  Allen—whose upper arm was grazed by one of Jackson’s bullets—said Lewis had persuaded him to commit the holdups after meeting him in a bar, and Allen had agreed since he needed the money to marry a 17 year-old girl. So much for their next planned venture, which was knocking over a store at Slauson and Vermont.<br>

November 14, 1947</b>.   Edna Grover, a raven-haired 20 year-old model, calls the Elmar home.  But it was at the home of photographer William Kemp, 1830 Redesdale Avenue, where investigators from the DA’s office found over 1,000 lewd photos of Edna.  Kemp was fined $350 ($3,678 current USD) and given a 180-day suspended jail sentence, while our Elmarette was granted probation for her provocative posing.</p>

Martin Salas, 23, left the Elmar’s confines for an early morning <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;saddr=S+Main+St+%26+E+5th+St,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90013&amp;daddr=W+6th+St+at+Spring+St,+90013+to:W+3rd+St+%26+S+Spring,+90013+to:W+2nd+St+%26+S+Spring,+Los+Angeles,+Ca+to:W+3rd+St+%26+Figueroa,+Los+Angeles,+CA&amp;mra=pi&amp;mrcr=3&amp;sll=34.047735,-118.249412&amp;sspn=0.009032,0.014591&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=34.051664,-118.250999&amp;spn=0.018063,0.029182&amp;z=15" title="wildride" target="_blank">spin</a> this day.  At Fifth and Main he hit a truck and injured the driver; he had an argument over right-of-way with a parked car at Sixth and Spring, and another wouldn’t get out of the way at Third and Spring, and he had a metallic argument with another parked car at Second and Spring.  Undaunted, he piloted smack dab into an RKO movie shoot at Third and Figueroa (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0045205/" title="sf" target="_blank"><i>Sudden Fear</i></a>?  <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0044417/" title="bml" target="_blank"><i>Beware, My Lovely</i></a>?) where a motorist that’d tailed him flagged down a cop.  The officer jerked open Salas’ door, only to have Salas step on the gas, forcing the cop to run alongside until enough cops tackled the car and forced it to stop.  At some point during Mr. Salas’ wild ride he’d had a passenger who ditched in an awful (in every sense of the word) hurry—hair was found on the windshield of the passenger side.  Salas was booked on felony hit-and-run.</p>
<p><b>March 4, 1953</b>.  Jack Hodges is 26, an unemployed aircraft worker, and lives a stone’s throw from the top of Angels Flight at 314 South Olive.  His pal Dean Coleman, 22, is in school to learn <a href="https://www.smcelectronics.com/tvrep.htm" title="imakemoneyinmysparetime" target="_blank">television repair</a>, and bunks at the Elmar.  When Coleman isn’t in school, the two of them visit the local hotels.  With their signature sawed-off shotgun and a briefcase.  The only robbery Coleman didn’t accompany Hodges on, of course, was the time Hodges robbed the night clerk of the Elmar.  </p>
<p>Coleman’s money wore thin and he’d pawned his television repair apparatuses, and went shotgun-brandishing to get the stuff out of hock.  Unfortunately for Coleman, Hodges pawned a stolen wristwatch, which led police to an old mugshot of Hodges; a little police work later and Hodges was caught in a bar at Sixth and Hill, his sawed-off shotgun and briefcase found in his Olive St. hotel room closet.    He gave up Coleman, who was arrested while watching television in the lobby of 235 S. Hope.<br>

Coleman, who studied dramatics before his decision to become a television repair man, was never meant to be a shotgun-wielding, hotel-clerk robbing gunman in real life.  “As you see I don’t appear to be a tough guy,”&#157; said Coleman, “but I can act the part when the occasion warrants.”&#157;</p>

<b><br>
July 22, 1956</b>.   Elmar resident Frank Swope, 33, took offense at fellow Bunker Hiller Harold J. McAnally, 57—McAnally lived one block west at 230 South Flower—buying a lady a drink one summer day in a bar at 822 West Third Street.  So Swope walked up and pushed McAnally from his stool, whereupon McAnally landed head-first on the concrete floor.  A few hours after McAnally died from his skull fracture, Swope surrendered to authorities at the Elmar.</p>

February 7, 1957</b>.  LAPD went to investigate a disturbance in a bar at 731 West Third and there arrested “Allan Ayers,”&#157; 32, a resident of the Elmar&#8230;</p>

<p>&#8230;turns out our Elmaree was in reality August Gerbitz, two years on the lam from a double murder rap in Evansville, where in December 1954 he gunned down his girlfriend, Mrs. Nadine Martin, 21, and one George Temme, 38.</p>

March 20, 1957</b>.  Salvador Perez and Jesus Cruz, both 27, had been popped by narco and were up on the fourth floor of Police Administration, having been photographed at the lab.  They were walked into the hallway by officers Hernandez and Ruddell to be cuffed and led to the first-floor Central Jail for booking.</p>
<p>That’s when both of them made a break for it.  Cruz, of 4923 Gratian Street, was tackled by Ruddell right out of the gate.  Perez, he of 235 South Hope, dashed down the stairway.  Officer Hernandez slipped and fell, broke his ankle, but continued to give chase nevertheless.  Perez ran down to the ground level and made a wrong turn toward Central Jail, turned and ran past Hernandez, but unfortunately, into the arms of Lt. Arroyo.  Another vacancy at the Elmar as Perez (and his buddy Cruz) are booked by an out-of-breath, broken-ankled cop on felony violation of the State Narcotics Act.</p>

Perhaps you too can soak up enough of its magic to place you on this honored roll.</p>
<p>Alas, the City has wiped Hope clean, and thereafter had it thoroughly disinfected, as one would to so much egesta on a cracked tile floor.  They have left us with the most barely readable of palimpsests.  Let’s take a look.</p>
<p>Hope Street had two levels between Second and Third; here, we are looking north toward Second, standing above the west end of the Third Street tunnel.  The Elmar was midway along the block.</p>

The Ghost Elmar floats roughly above an intersection made by a new street, named after a Lithuanian-Ruthenian <a href="https://www.ruf.rice.edu/~sarmatia/100/thompson.html" title="Kosciuszko" target="_blank">nobleman-turned-revolutionary</a>.  I betcha Frank Swope or Edna Grover never woulda guessed.</p>
<p>The City doesn&#8217;t screw around when they want something bad enough.  They&#8217;ll move mountains, quite literally, to which these images taken across from the Elmar (looking south down Hope toward the library) attest:</p>

</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">The story had all of the elements of a lurid tale from a sleazy detective magazine.<span>Â  </span>Barbara Graham, abandoned by her <img loading="lazy" border="0" align="right" width="240" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2290/2494344351_e7126a6604_m.jpg" alt="Santo Perkins Graham" height="170">teenaged mother in <city w:st="on"><place w:st="on">Oakland</place></city> years before, had spent time in the same reformatory where her mom was an alumnus. Barbara had worked as a prostitute, and had become addicted to drugs. She’d been introduced to her co-defendants by none other than her husband, Henry, a small time career criminal. It was rumored that not only was Barbara having an affair with Perkins – but also that she, Perkins, and <city w:st="on"><place w:st="on">Santos</place></city> were frequently engaged in threesomes. The press had a field day.</span>
</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"></span>
</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">The crime itself was apparently the result of misinformation given to Perkins. He was told that Mrs. Monahan (former mother-in-law of Las Vegas gambler Tutor Scherer) had a sack full of money and jewelry that she kept in her home (the same kind of tragic misunderstanding would result in the brutal murder of the Clutter family in Kansas in 1959, and become the subject of Truman Capote’s brilliant novel, “In Cold Blood”&#157;).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">On the night of March 9, 1953, the gang drove to Mrs. Monahan’s home in <place w:st="on"><city w:st="on">Burbank</city></place>. Barbara knocked on the front door and told the woman that her car had broken down, and asked to use the telephone.<span>Â  </span>The men were waiting right behind Barbara and before Mrs. Monahan could respond, they all pushed their way into the house where they immediately started screaming at her. The gang of strung out miscreants kept demanding to be told where she kept her money and jewelry.<p></p></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"><p>Â </p></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"><p></p></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">Mrs. Monahan repeatedly told the crooks that she didn’t keep cash at home, but they were so hopped up on drugs and adrenaline that they didn’t believe her.<span>Â  </span>One version of the story was that Barbara started to beat the victim with a pistol while the men laughed and egged her on. The older woman was beaten to the floor by “Bloody Babs”&#157;, as she would later be dubbed by the press, who then smothered the victim to death by tightening a pillowcase over her head.<span>Â  </span>Not surprisingly, Babs’ version of the story shifted the blame onto her partners.<span>Â  </span>But as far as the law was concerned, since all the defendants were present during the commission of the murder, they all shared the guilt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"><img loading="lazy" border="0" align="left" width="116" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2298/2495164948_6c6a6d3e13_m.jpg" alt="Baxter Shorter" height="240"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">It wasn’t until the suspects had been identified and arrests had been made that the tale would take a turn onto <place w:st="on">Bunker Hill</place>.<span>Â  </span>Once the drugs and false bravado had worn off and the specter of possible death sentences began to loom large, it was a sure thing that a member of the gang would look to the law for a deal. It was Baxter Shorter who decided to save himself by spilling his guts to the DA. Shorter was an ex-con and a known associate of LA’s premier gangster, the diminutive but lethal Mickey Cohen. Shorter’s friends got wind of his visits with the DA, and they became very nervous.</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"><p>Â </p></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"><p></p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">Baxter and his wife Olivia lived in an apartment at 121 N. Flower, and it was from that location that Shorter was kidnapped by two men. In a photo shown to her by police, Olivia identified one of<img loading="lazy" border="0" align="right" width="240" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2095/2495164990_a94ff2fd1b_m.jpg" alt="121 N Flower" height="195"> the kidnappers as Emmett Perkins. The other man was almost certainly <city w:st="on"><place w:st="on">Santos</place></city>. No shrinking violet, Olivia tried halting the kidnapping by brandishing a 30-30 carbine at the husband snatchers, but they told her that they’d shoot her where she stood if she didn’t back off. Olivia told the cops that she had seen a female in the men’s car. She wasn’t able to get close enough to provide a description of the woman, but she was able to describe the car as a 1951 Dodge or <city w:st="on"><place w:st="on">Plymouth</place></city> five passenger coupe – coincidentally, the same kind of car owned by Barbara. Once the car sped away, Baxter Shorter vanished forever.<span>Â  </span>Nary a bone fragment nor a tooth would ever surface, and he would be declared legally dead in 1960.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">Barbara maintained her innocence until the end. Being a mother of three, she may have avoided the death penalty if she<img loading="lazy" border="0" align="right" width="187" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2256/2494344297_ac81b8a481_m.jpg" alt="Barbara Graham" height="240"> hadn’t made the mistake of offering a fellow inmate $25k to provide her with an alibi for the night of the murder. Unfortunately for her, the cellmate was actually a cop, planted to befriend her and gather information. Barbara’s blunder had doomed her to death. <p></p></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">Santo, Perkins, and Barbara would all die in San Quentin’s gas chamber on the same day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">Graham’s execution was the paradigm for cruel and unusual punishment and would be the topic of many impassioned editorials, even by supporters of the death penalty. On the morning of her execution she’d dressed in a beige wool suit and brown pumps, and had tried to prepare herself to face death. She was scheduled to die at 10:00 am on June 3, 1955, but was granted a stay until 10:45 am. Her execution would be delayed one more time, causing Barbara to ask “Why do they torture me?”&#157;<span>Â  </span>Finally at 11:28 am Barbara was blindfolded at her request, and was led from the holding cell to the gas chamber.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">In a macabre moment the executioner, Joe Feretti, gave the condemned woman a bit of advice: “Now take a deep breath and it won’t be so bad”&#157; – to which she replied, “How the hell would you know?”&#157;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">For a fictionalized account of Graham’s story, rent a copy of the 1958 film, “I Want to Live!”&#157; starring Susan Hayward.<p></p></span></p>

		<p>Location: 350 Clay Street<br>
Date: June 3, 1946</p>
<p>In the not-quite-twelve hours since John M. Kelly was discharged from the Marine Corps, he somehow took up with Henry Ehlert, 44, and Dwight C. Lester, 23, of this address and John Graham, 43, a Naval chief petty officer stationed in San Diego.</p>
<p>Kelly&#8217;s first night as a civilian was a notable one: he and his pals drew the attention of Traffic Officer F.J. Rees, investigating reports of a holdup in an alley between Main and Spring, and when Kelly made a funny move when ordered to put &#8217;em up, Rees shot half his face off.</p>
<p>Kelly survived long enough to be booked on robbery charges in the prison ward of General Hospital, while his pals cooled their heels in County Jail. But the lack of any follow up to this story makes one wonder if Rees had an itchy finger, and the arrests were meant to cover up an accidental shooting of an innocent man. </p>
<p>The previous November 10, hapless Dwight C. Lester, then residing at 300 S. Olive Street, somehow lost his footing, fell under the up-bound Angels Flight car and was dragged about 60 feet before engineer Elmer Miller heard him hollering and braked. He escaped with friction burns and lacerations. Below, a photograph of his rescue.<br>

<p>John Roebling tells police that as far as his confused memory can be relied on, a man and a young woman clad in boy&#8217;s clothing chloroformed him in his room and relieved him of $20 before fleeing in a car. We cannot but suspect the full story is more interesting, and regret Mr. Roebling&#8217;s discretion.</p>

		<p>Date:  March 26, 1947</p>
<p>Having described the <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/theDome" title="dadome" target="_blank">Dome</a> to you in some detail, we figured it would be in the interest of OBH readers to be kept <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/DomeDenizenSmith" title="bgirl" target="_blank">abreast</a> of the hotel’s <a href="https://www.onbunkerhill.org/sickmanjumps" title="jumper" target="_blank">tenants</a>.  Enter Carl F. Brannon.</p>
<p>Carl called 201 South Grand home.  He worked down at the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/79761301@N00/2378839160/" title="gowayne" target="_blank">Simon’s Drive-In</a> at <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=S+Figueroa+St+%26+Exposition+Blvd,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90007&amp;jsv=107&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=68.98527,108.984375&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=34.019034,-118.282413&amp;spn=0.009035,0.013304&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr" title="simonize" target="_blank">3607 South Figueroa,</a> as manager no less.  A man of quality.  And bravery, to take on such a dangerous job.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3110/2426104724_e73b2b8811_o.gif" alt="notthesimonsonfig" align="left" height="350" width="265">Dangerous?  Yes!  Brannon was held up by two men, robbed of $1,000, and slashed with a razor blade when he courageously resisted.  </p>
<p>Detective Sgts. Lambert and Thedens of Univeristy Division quizzed him all about the incident, and that fishy smell, the one that didn’t emanate from Simon’s deep-fryer.  Police Forensic Chemist Ray Pinker gave Brannon’s superficial wounds a look-see, and let’s face it, it’s <i>hard</i> to slash yourself.  </p>
<p>Turns out Brannon had lost heavily in the Vegas gambling houses (running afoul of the El Rancho, Last Frontier, and Benji Siegel’s newly opened Flamingo, no doubt) and took the money to make good on his losses.  $861 was found in a crock in Simon’s storeroom.  </p>
<p>Brannon’ll spend a little time in stir before he slinks his sad-slashed self back to the Dome.</p>

The Astoria contains over 125 guest rooms, beautifully furnished.  Many are en suite, with parlor, bedroom and bath, dining-room and kitchen.  A number of single rooms are also provided, both with and without private bath.  Among the attractive features of the Astoria is the beautiful view of the city to be obtained from practically every room of the building.  A spacious office and lobby, a dainty ladies’ reception-room, and a dancing hall are some the features which have been provided by E. W. Smith, the owner of the building.  These are handsomely decorated and furnished, and will undoubtedly serve to make the Astoria popular.  </i>

<p>—December 17, 1905</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before Bunker Hill hit its cinematic skids, t’was the place of purloinery more aligned with the tony climes of Monte Carlo than El Monte:  cat-burgling jewel thieves were at <img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3076/2420296782_74d6ffbdaf_o.gif" alt="purloinery" align="left" height="173" width="284">work!  In October of 1911, Astoria resident Mrs. W. F. Sapp returned to her room one afternoon to find…nothing amiss.  But her mother, Mrs. W. W. Loomis, of the adjoining apartment, called attention to having heard her daughter next door at her writing desk while said daughter was supposed to be absent.  They opened the locked writing desk…to behold…<i>gasp</i>!  The chatelaine bag, lockets and bracelets and the like were gone, as was the ancestral family tin box (found later in the lavatory, a can opener found on the fifth floor above) once filled with gold watches, fobs, and diamond-set pieces, now scattered to the underworld of crooked, loupe-wearing bangle merchants.</p>
<p>But not all crimes at the Astoria were so <i>quaint</i>.<br>
<img loading="lazy" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2062/2418256946_b9545ff293_o.gif" alt="astoria50s" height="390" width="550"><br>
Edna A. Worden lived in the Astoria.  Forty-eight, New Hampshirite, kept to herself mostly, known around the place as a woman of culture and refinement.   Kept the bookshelves of her one-bedroom in the Astoria lined with Shakespeare, Milton, Dante, Dickens, Byron, Poe, the Greek philosophers, and many a Bible.  She made a meager wage as a WPA worker, and with the monthly $30 sent to her by her ex-husband back east, made a good life for her and her twelve year-old daughter Marguerite.</p>
<p>Marguerite, a student at Belmont Junior High School who, had she made it to Monday, was to have entered a Beverly Hills school for girls.  </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2115/2419482523_d626744857_o.gif" alt="MargueriteW" align="right" height="500" width="259">Sunday, April 4, 1937.  Little Marguerite made a habit of always coming down to the desk to borrow the Sunday paper.  This morning she did not.  A concerned John Riley, the elevator operator, put an ear to the Wordens’ door and ascertained a low moan; he summoned Astoria manager J. E. Harrigan, who, with his trusty stepladder, peered through the transom.  After what he saw police arrived in short order and even hardened Detective Lieutenants Ledbetter, Bryan and Lopez, after kicking in the door, had to halt in their tracks at the horror that lay in wait.  </p>
<p>Edna lay sprawled over a cot in an array of splatter, her head against the floor.  Marguerite was on the bed, her head covered with a pillow, topped with a discarded brickbat, mortar glued to its sides, sticky with blood and gore. The room was cluttered, revealing a desperate struggle during their sexual assaults and skull shatterings.  Edna’s purse was turned inside-out, otherwise, the room was unrifled—Marguerite’s mute witness rag doll, her ivory-bound prayer book with a shiny dime atop, her freshly washed and ironed blue gingham dress on a nail above the bed.  The fates conspired to aid their attacker; on one side of the apartment was a storeroom, on the other, the apartment of old Harry Tutin, partially deaf.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3002/2418256992_758d1be89d_o.gif" alt="downolive" align="left" height="212" width="300">The Wordens&#8217; attacker or attackers had climbed the Angels Flight stairs and forced entry through the kitchen window just below Olive Street.  Shoes were removed before climbing in—traces of sock wool were removed from the plaster casts.  (The feet, size eleven.)  The assailant is almost certainly responsible for the March 2nd rape and brick-administered basal skull-smashing of <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=651+Stanford+Ave,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90021&amp;jsv=107&amp;sll=34.041405,-118.243833&amp;sspn=0.008375,0.018947&amp;layer=c&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=34.041405,-118.243704&amp;spn=0.008375,0.018947&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr&amp;cbll=34.039892,-118.243613" title="valdezmurder" target="_blank">Rose Valdez</a>, 20, attacked while her year-old baby slept in a crib by her side. <br>

Bunker Hill was blanketed by the entire homicide squad assigned to all-night duty, with four squads of regular detectives and fifty men from Metro combing the City for suspicious Black Men—not exactly racial profiling, since it was a black man who ran from the scene of the attempted January 25 brick-attack on Mrs. H.

<p>Assorted Los Angeles sickos—<i>alleged</i>—were brought in for questioning, their faces and addresses plastered throughout the papers (doubtlessly tarnishing their lives forevermore) but all were cleared, not only through their alibis, but because the Worden killer had the bad fortune of leaving something else behind besides his brickbat:  before putting on his gloves, he moved a milk bottle.  Fingerprint central.  </p>
<p>So if the killer skipped town, there’s a good chance he could have, would have never been caught.  But a certain Robert Nixon just had to kill women.  With bricks.  This time in Chicago, on May 28, 1938, the nineteen year-old Nixon brick’d Mrs. Florence Johnson, wife of a Chicago city fireman, and gets popped for it, and confesses.  A little digging revealed that during the time of the Worden and Valdez killings, he lived at <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=803+S+Central+Ave,+90021&amp;jsv=107&amp;sll=34.033528,-118.243339&amp;sspn=0.008553,0.01457&amp;layer=c&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=34.034951,-118.243339&amp;spn=0.008553,0.01457&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr&amp;cbll=34.033518,-118.243315" title="nixonsplace" target="_blank">803 South Central Avenue</a>.  </p>
<p>Nixon initially denied involvement with the crimes, but after LA Police Chief Davis announced that comparison of fingerprints made positive identification of Nixon, Nixon admitted to the whole brick-laden shebang—the Wordens and Valdez, plus the Chicago murders of Mrs. Florence Thompson Castle in her hotel room in 1936, and the rape/murder of student nurse Anna Kuchta in August 1937, and assaults on at least seventeen other women.</p>

In June 1938, Howard Jones Green, Nixon’s sometime accomplice, was shipped from Chicago to view the murder scene at the Astoria.  He admitted to beating little Marguerite on the head (with his pistol butt, and not the brick) but denied partaking in the sexual assault, and admitted they grossed all of eight dollars from the venture.  He &#8216;fessed up to the March ’37 Zoe Damrell attack and for that was given five to life; what became of his Marguerite trial we’re not told.</p>
<p>On June 16, 1939, Robert Nixon went to the chair at the Cook County Jail.  Thus, he did not live to read 1940’s smash lit-hit <i>Native Son</i>, which explained that his predicament was destiny, a societal byproduct of racist racial conditioning.  So argued the lawyer for <i>Native Son</i>&#8216;s protagonist Bigger Thomas, accused of killing a white woman in Chicago, as penned by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Wright_(author)" title="Wrightian" target="_blank">Richard Wright</a>, who made great use of the sensationalistic Robert Nixon <a href="https://etext.virginia.edu/railton/enam312/rwhp.html" title="windypapers" target="_blank">newspaper reporting</a> at the time.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Less than a decade later, plans were underway to remove every trace of Bunker Hill&#8217;s 136 acres from existence.  After a four million dollar increase in annual taxes, and a grant from the federal Urban Renewal Program, oil tycoon William T. Sesnon Jr. finally began his twelve-year-in-the-making dream of wholesale land acquisition in October 1960.  Nine thousand persons were eventually displaced, and the first building to be demolished was the Astoria’s neighbor, the Hillcrest, in September 1961.  The Astoria went soon after.  The land sat barren for eighteen years until the federally subsidized, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Dworsky" title="dworky" target="_blank">Dworsky</a> modular prefab <a href="https://www.angelusplaza.org/RHFCMS/CommunityView.aspx?id=383" title="AP" target="_blank">Angelus Plaza</a> (designed with a 1200&#8242; People Mover) broke ground in 1979.</p>

		<p>Location: 255 South Bunker Hill Avenue<br>
Date: January 22, 1918</p>
<p>Herbert Maas, 19, resident of the Alta Vista at 255 South Bunker Hill Avenue, was strolling with Alice Averill of 332 South Bunker Hill near Fifth and Fremont Streets when they were accosted by a four bandits who pulled up beside them in a car. Two of the men jumped out and grabbed Herbert, hustling him into the back seat. Then they drove away, leaving Miss Averill on the sidewalk. Near Orange and Figueroa the crooks relieved Herbert at gunpoint of $15, a gold watch and a stickpin. He must have been anticipating they&#8217;d soon release him when the man on his left, shaking from nervousness, suddenly fired his weapon. The bullet went through Herbert&#8217;s back, and next thing he knew, he&#8217;d been shoved onto the street in front of 1127 Orange Street. The wounded man made it into the Baltic Apartments, where he found aid and was taken to the Receiving Hospital, where he was listed in serious condition with a bullet through his lumbar region possibly nicking his peritoneum. A search was on for the highwayman, but there was no further news published about Herbert&#8217;s condition or any arrests. Ten years later, an Alice Averill was appearing around town as a chorus girl, in &quot;Topsy and Eva&quot; (a part she repeated on Broadway) and &quot;A Connecticut Yankee.&quot;</p>
