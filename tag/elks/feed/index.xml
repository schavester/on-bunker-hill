<p>So what of the Elks Lodge, which supplanted the Crocker (having its 100th anniversary demolition party in a few weeks), that squarish building noted more for giving the world the Angels Flight gateway than for being, well, a squarish building?<br />
<img loading="lazy" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2039/2440495858_54ea8f10ea_o.gif" alt="xmarksthespot" height="535" width="575" /><br />
There were in fact two <a href="http://www.phoenixmasonry.org/masonicmuseum/fraternalism/elks.htm" title="thelks" target="_blank">BPOE</a> buildings.  The main building fronting Clay Street, at 60&#215;90&#8242;, contained an auditorium, dance hall, dormitories and offices; the Annex above at 300 South Olive, on the site of the June ”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />08-demolished Crocker (where District Deputy Grand Exalted Ruler John Whichner placed Elks Lodge No. 99 roster, and copies of the September 2, 1908 newspapers in the cornerstone), was 54&#215;64&#8242;, and full of reading and writing rooms, plus a billiard hall and card parlors–everything a fraternal organization needed. </p>
<p>At least for a little while.  By 1925 the Elks had built much larger and <a href="http://www.you-are-here.com/building/park_plaza.html" title="thenewlodge" target="_blank">schmantzier digs</a> over by Westlake park.  </p>
<p>300 South Olive wouldn”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t go to waste, though, as the Elks”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> brothers-in-fraternity, the Loyal Order of <a href="http://www.phoenixmasonry.org/masonicmuseum/fraternalism/moose.htm" title="themoose" target="_blank">Moose</a>, took over the buildings.  They covered &quot;BPOE&quot; on the aforementioned Angels Flight archway and set about putting a lot of boxers to work.  1931:<br />
<img loading="lazy" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2095/2440495602_a70cffa799_o.gif" alt="rockmsockmrobots" height="118" width="250" /><br />
And 1951:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3053/2440495570_c79a452513_o.gif" alt="JC" height="300" width="241" /></p>
<p>No, not that <a href="http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/carter-j.htm" title="hailtothechief" target="_blank">Jimmy Carter</a>.  </p>
<p>The Moose hung on, and kept the building til the end, despite it becoming the Royal Club:<br />

Nice quoins.</p>
<p>In September of 1962 it was just one more structure on the business end of the CRA”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s bulldozers:</p>

<p>An old-timer on the hill, Austin Blackburn, 59, of 529 W 3rd St, said the building was a lodge meeting place when he took up residence at the now-demolished Cumberland hotel, across the street at 243 S Olive, 35 years ago.  “The Royal, and all the rest of the hill, was a wonderful place then,” he reminisced.  “They used to put on free shows and boxing matches in the theater for the folks who lived here.  Later it was a dance hall, and during World War II they made a hotel out of it.  At one time boxers used to train in a small gymnasium there.”</i>

<p>The question being, of course, what became of the cornerstone filled with 1908 newspapers and the Elks&#8217; club roster?</p>

At the turn of the 20th Century, no building dominated Bunker Hill like the Crocker Mansion. Perched high at the corner of Third and Olive, the imposing 3-story Victorian structure overlooked the emerging metropolis for a mere 22 years. Though its reign over Bunker Hill was short, the Crocker Mansion remains an indelible part of early Los Angeles history.

Designed by architect John Hall and erected in 1886, the ornate residence was built by Mrs. Margaret E. Crocker at a cost of $45,000 (a little over a million in today&#8217;s dollars). Margaret was the widow of Edwin Bryant Crocker, a California Supreme Court Justice, who with his brother, Charles, amassed a fortune in the railroad industry.  Following her husband&#8217;s death in 1875, Mrs. Crocker became a known social and civic leader who had donated the family&#8217;s impressive <a href="http://www.crockerartmuseum.org/about/history_crockers.htm" title="Crocker Art Museum" target="_blank">art collection</a> to the city of Sacramento. At the time she commissioned the Los Angeles residence, Mrs. Crocker owned homes in Sacramento, Lake Tahoe, San Francisco and New York.

In 1887, the mansion became the center of a scandal when Alma Ashe, Margaret Crocker&#8217;s granddaughter, was kidnapped from the residence.

Two-year-old Alma was the daughter of Amy Crocker and playboy Robert Porter Ashe, who had previously scandalized the family in 1882 by eloping. Rumored to have married Miss Crocker for the family riches, Amy soon grew weary of her groom, who spent plenty of time and money at the racetrack. The marriage soon went south and in April 1887, Ashe marched into the Crocker Mansion and marched out with his daughter, who was being watched by relatives while her mother and grandmother were out of town. Ashe and the child holed up in the St. Elmo Hotel on Main Street for a couple of days until a judge formally ordered he hand the child over to the Crockers. Ashe claimed he was protecting his daughter from her unfit mother, while Amy claimed her husband was attempting to gain leverage over her by imprisoning the child. Ultimately, grandma took Alma to live in Europe until she was old enough to decide which parent she preferred to live with. The Ashe-Crocker union was officially dissolved a few months later, and Amy (later going by Aimee) would ignore the incident altogether in her 1936 memoir <i>”¦And I”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />d Do it Again. </i>

In 1891, the Crocker Mansion became a boarding house/hotel, though far ritzier than the faded Bunker Hill boarding rooms of the 1940s/50s. Though Mrs. Crocker was no longer residing there, she still maintained ownership of the stately structure that played host to many a member of society”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s elite. Even as a commercial property, rooms were always advertised as located in the “Crocker Mansion.”

<p class="MsoNormal">
Construction on the Third Street tunnel began in 1900, and Mrs. Crocker filed a petition claiming that the mansion was endangered by the street tunnel which was “unsafe, improperly constructed and a veritable death trap.” According to the Los Angeles Times, “the walls of her house are settling, the foundations giving way and the plaster is falling off”¦Unless something is done, the building is liable to topple into a hole.” The house never did topple and was alive and well in 1902 when Angels Flight began operating and dropping riders off practically on the Crocker doorstep.

Margaret Crocker died in 1901 and possession of the mansion was assumed by her children, except for hell-cat Aimee who had been left out of the will. The mansion was sold in 1905 for $50,000 along with the land that ran 120 feet on Olive and 150 feet on Third, down to Clay Street. The Crocker Mansion subsequently closed its doors as a boarding house and plans were soon drawn up to renovate the residence for use as social quarters for the Elk”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s, who were putting up a new building on the eastern portion of the property. When the frame of the “old” house was deemed too weak, the Crocker Mansion was scheduled for demolition, to be replaced by a reinforced concrete structure.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
The Victorian building was razed in June 1908 and the cornerstone for the Elk”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Annex was laid the following September.

<p>Toodle down Hill Street between 3rd and 4th and eavesdrop on the guy with the clipboard, yelling at the zinc oxide”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />d folk, and get the five-cent explication:</p>
<div align="justify"><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2372/2355969037_a60c9e93e8_o.gif" width="262" height="400" align="right" alt="earlyaf" />“Up there”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Bunker Hill, folks, and what a pain it was to shlep from your gracious home down to the Grand Central Market below, there, behind you.  But then came riding up lawyer, engineer, friend of Lincoln, Colonel James Ward Eddy, who was sixty-nine when he convinced the city that it needed a funicular in the 3rd street right-of-way between Hill and Olive.  Eddy built ”˜The Los Angeles Incline Railway,”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> known to all and sundry as Angels Flight, no apostrophe thank you, complete with a hundred-foot observation tower that housed a camera obscura.  Mayor Snyder made the inaugural 45-second journey on January 1, 1902.  The cars were biblically named ”˜Olivet”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> and ”˜Sinai”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> and were painted a saintly white, though later orange and red, and a trip up the 325 feet of 33% grade was originally a penny, though they jacked that up to a nickel.  What”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s with the BPOE arch, you ask?  Did the Benevolent Protective Order of Elk have a hand in all this?  Not really.  A hundred years ago the Elk&#8217;d go nuts during &#8216;Elk Week&#8217; and spend lavish sums all over the city with fireworks and <img loading="lazy" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2147/2356801758_fab68ea162_o.gif" width="267" height="400" align="left" alt="aflater" />carnivals and since their lodge replaced the Crocker mansion at the top of Angels Flight in September 1908, they elected to donate this swell gate here around 1909.  The BPOE lettering on the arch was actually covered up for many decades when the building above became a Moose lodge in 1926.  Anyway, as the city moved west, the gingerbread private homes of the 1890s were cut up into rooming houses, and Bunker Hill took on all that charm we now call shabby chic.  In 1950, large insurance companies, the Building Owners and Managers Association, and the Community Redevelopment Association proposed the razing of Bunker Hill to develop 10,000 rental units.  In 1959 the City Council declared Bunker Hill blighted, a slum to be cleared and redeveloped.  The Elks Lodge/Moose Lodge gets wiped away in 1962.  In 1969 Angels Flight was finally removed and stored, with a promise to return it shortly.  It was reinstalled here, half a block down, a mere twenty-seven years later, though a tragic accident in 2001 has closed it temporarily.”</div>
<p>These are the nuts and bolts to be sure, though what they don”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t add are the drops of <i>blood</i> that oil the gears of <i>doom</i> and the cogs of <i>death</i>!</p>
<p>That may be a bit dramatic.  There <i>is</i> the small matter of the 1913 derailment, of course.</p>

<p>Everything was running smoothly during a September evening rush hour, when the control shaft connecting the safety winch <img loading="lazy" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2001/2355348905_aebe5a45ec_o.gif" width="400" height="254" align="right" alt="leaphostetterleap" />hoist busted, sending Sinai plummeting down the incline.  The worst injury was actually a Mrs. Hostetter (of the <a href="http://helios.library.ca.gov/soca/reagh/1990-0572.jpg" target="_blank" title="notelijahlovejoy">Lovejoy</a> Apartments at Third and Grand) who, had she not elected to leap from Sinai, wouldn”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t have broken her collarbone.  All other injuries were comparatively minor.<br /><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2325/2355324379_e6fab988e2_o.gif" width="500" height="337" alt="derail2" /></p>
<p>Subsequent death and (near) dismemberment wasn”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t the Flight”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s fault–in 1937 Jack Claus, 54 year-old salesman, decided to take a midday siesta on the tracks.</p>

<p>When a car traveling down the incline suddenly stopped, the operator had to amble down, reverse the motors, and find Sleepy Claus.  Claus had been dragged fifteen feet, his clothing torn from his body, but luckily no limbs; he survived with a crushed chest.  Less fortunate was the sailor who in 1943 decided to walk up the tracks: <br /><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2165/2355348977_70720e3e13_o.gif" width="248" height="226" alt="sailorsof1943" /></p>
<p>There”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s no such repeat incident in the remaining twenty-six years of our hero”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s tenure.  Dismantled in 1969, reinstalled in ”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />96, she returns to kill after a scant five years.  Why?  The Germans, who have a word for everything, have a word for what happened here.  <i>Schlimbesserung</i>.  Which roughly translates to “the farther ahead we go, the further behind we fall.”  It was just this sort of “worse bettering” that has put Angels Flight out of service.  In the seventy years Angels Flight did its thing, 1913 notwithstanding, all was fine:  it was a funicular like any other, and you don”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t improve upon perfection–counterbalance, a cable, a safety cable.  It”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s not rocket science.  But then:  as is always the case with people, who feel like they have to <i>do something</i> when they have a job, and therefore complicate matters (if this wasn&#8217;t a case of trying to &quot;save money,&quot; then it&#8217;s got to be nepotism), some City  someone <img loading="lazy" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2409/2356218968_7214deb0d2_o.jpg" width="300" height="186" align="left" alt="crash" />hired an entity absurdly ill-suited to the task of restoring Angels Flight:  Lift Engineering.  Lift Engineering built ski lifts.  Ski lifts that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lift_Engineering" target="_blank" title="lifttoheaven">killed people</a>.  This character Kunczynski worked on Angels Flight, added a whole system of independent cables with brake drums interlaced with various gears, which stripped and made the drums useless, and guess what folks, if we”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />d retained our Edwardian technology, we”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />d have a surviving survivor (Leon Praport, RIP, survived a Polish death camp, only to be taken out by another piece of ultra-modern cleverness). Kunczynski has fled to Mexico with a briefcase full of your tax dollars. </p>
<p>When will she return?  It&#8217;s instructive to recall the 27 years she was gone after having been promised a speedy boomerang.</p>
<p>In 1962 taxpayers gave the CRA $35,000 ($240,000 USD2007) to “buy” Angels Flight, so that the CRA could, according to its chairman William T. Sesnon Jr., relocate the railway in Griffith Park or the Hollywood Bowl.</p>

<p>CRA officials change the plan slightly when they announce in September 1968 that Angels Flight would have to come down–temporarily–to be stored for two years, and then replaced at the same site (shortened, of course, given as they were grading thirty some-odd feet from the Hill). By the time of the CRA”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s brief civic ceremony “dismantling event” held in May 16, 1969, they”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />d already realized the railway would have to be stored until the Hill was completely developed.  Surely <i>that</i> wouldn”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t take so long.  </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2353/2356157000_4217e26a41_o.gif" width="375" height="233" align="right" alt="clatterclatter" />Certainly many breathed a sigh of relief.  Gone was that clattering anachronism, garbed in the orange and black of an Edwardian Hallowe”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />en, which could no longer connect the downmarket quaffers of cheap chop suey with the newly ensconced deadbolted seniors and senior bankers and the like.  <br /><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2216/2355923591_eaa2618f50_o.gif" width="400" height="311" alt="AF50s" /></p>

<p>But still, a promise was a promise, and in a scant twenty-seven years, the CRA did in fact make good on its promise. With the needling of one John Welborne, and the Conservancy, and some other interested parties.  <br /><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2091/2355324139_6a2001432e_o.gif" width="500" height="288" alt="thelawofreturn" /></p>
<p>Waiting for their return, once more:</p>

<p>Many long for the return of the cars and restoration of the Flight, and demand that the City get involved–again.  Granted, that Angels Flight is privately run (Welborne”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Angels Flight Railway Foundation) can mean problems, as anyone who”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s ever passed a hat can tell you.  Fears of an MTA takeover appear to have been <a href="http://www.angelenic.com/metro-in-possession-of-angels-flight/" target="_blank" title="MTAuhoh">unwarranted</a>, however, and apparently, the long road toward repair may be at <a href="http://www.angelenic.com/its-a-miracle-angels-flight-sees-the-light/" target="_blank" title="lightattheendofthefunicular">an end</a>.  People can take all the potshots they want at Mr. Welborne, or execrate the heavens for the very existence of delays in general, but if it takes another ten years, the fact that we”<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />d have Angels Flight in Los Angeles at all would be nothing less than a miracle.</p>
