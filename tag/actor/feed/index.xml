Date: September 2, 1917</p>
<p>When George Luvich walked into the Bella Napoli Cafe with the intention of encouraging Mrs. Ethel Vluanik to leave with him,Â  he certainly didn&#8217;t expect to make the next morning&#8217;s headlines as a &quot;crazed Austrian&quot; who had &quot;[run] Amuck.&quot; But you know how these things can escalate. </p>
<p>Sure, Ethel didn&#8217;t want to go, but she would have, if it wasn&#8217;t for that do-gooder movie actor <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0180679/ " target="_blank">Eugene Corey</a> (presently residing at the Hotel Northern, real name Gino Corrado), who took it upon himself to come to the lady&#8217;s aid and remove Luvitch from the building. Â </p>
<p>Well, what would you do? Luvitch pulled a gun, went back in and chased Corey out the back door, where he hopped the fence and went straight to the cops, the dirty fink. Patrolman R.P. Marks, several colleagues and a few newspapermen drove towards the Bella Napoli, arriving on the scene just after Luvitch shot at a man standing across the street, then ran south down Hill Street. As Marks pursued him, Luvitch wheeled out of a doorway and pulled his trigger twice, but the gun misfired. Marks managed to disarm the gunman, and he was marched off to the pokey on charges of attempted murder and assault.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a serious L.A. crime buff, you have been reading this tale with a slight sense of familiarity. Bella Napoli, you muse, isn&#8217;t that the place where the visiting New York mobsters got it and went face down in their ragu? Ah, but that was a different Bella Napoli, on Vermont Avenue, in the distant year 1933. Here&#8217;s a nice little apology ad the proprietor took out in the Times after the incident.<br />
