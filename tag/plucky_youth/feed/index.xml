<p>Six weeks ago, he and his mother moved to 111 S. Figueroa, right next door to the local traffic division, and Ronnie was overjoyed.  He started hanging around the station, and got to know the officers, who adopted him as a mascot of sorts.  He also followed them out on the streets, mimicking their lingo and actions.  Rather than being annoyed, the officers were so impressed with little Ronnie that they gave him a hat and a whistle, and put him to work.  Today, Ronnie directed traffic at 2nd and Figueroa, and Sgt. C.W. Nanney declared that his performance would be a credit to any veteran traffic cop.</p>
<p>However, Ronnie proved surprisingly easy to lure from his post.  When his mother appeared at the corner with an ice cream bar for her son, the hard-working lad went AWOL.</p>
