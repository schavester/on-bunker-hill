<p>‚Äù¬¶so now it‚Äù<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="‚Ñ¢" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s time to sew things up, recounting a collection of other Dome-flavored contretemps:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3188/2639344771_89d3266cbc_o.gif" alt="CookFight" align="left" height="172" width="227" /><b><br />
April 7, 1940</b>.  Mike Scaiola, 29, and Rocco Spagnuolo, 35, both cooks, were roomies at the Dome. Over what they argued in their Domeroom is lost to time; all that‚Äù<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="‚Ñ¢" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s known is what Scaiola later told the cops‚Äìduring a scuffle he saw the .32 automatic protruding from Spagnuolo‚Äù<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="‚Ñ¢" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s shirt and attempted to wrest it from him.  Oldest story in the world:  accidental discharge, someone takes one in the chest, and Spagnuolo‚Äù<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="‚Ñ¢" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s DOA at Georgia Street Receiving.  </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3032/2640171664_4b3a38e1ba_o.gif" alt="jackiejailed" align="right" height="180" width="216" /><b><br />
September 18, 1941</b>.  Mrs. Cleo (Jackie) Wooten, 19, was a plucky gal, but take this as a warning:  having pluck in spades gets the FBI involved.  Cleo was visiting friends in Cunningham, Kan. for some time and was there driving the car owned by Eddie Palzo of that city.  He had no objection to her driving the car around Cunningham, but swore out a felony complaint when the Dome resident decided to Dome home.  She was picked up at Third and Figueroa when an officer noticed the license on his stolen car list. </p>

July 4, 1942</b>.  The character of Dome resident Joe Barron, 28, cook (another cook?  Too many cooks really do spoil the pot), did not reflect well on the Dome‚Äù<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="‚Ñ¢" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s nobility.  He was strolling down Fifth Street and passed between one William O. Smith, 37, and Smith‚Äù<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="‚Ñ¢" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s 21 year-old wife Dorothy when he elected to make an off-color remark to the wife.  That didn‚Äù<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="‚Ñ¢" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t go over well with Mr. Smith, a recent transplant from Arkansas, who slashed Barron‚Äù<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="‚Ñ¢" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s throat, severing an artery.  Luckily, Dorothy instructed William to press his thumb on the artery to stanch the flow of blood, and they hauled Barron into a room at 107 E. Fifth until medical aid could be summoned.  Barron survived, we trust, wiser and more gentelmanly.</p>

December 21, 1942</b>.  Mrs. Leona Smith was followed home from a caf√É¬© last November 7, only to have her purse snatched‚Äìa purse containing $1600 in cash and checks and $4800 worth of jewelry ($6400=$89,216 USD2007).  After a month of searching by cops based on Leona‚Äù<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="‚Ñ¢" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s description of the man and his car, they finally popped Clifford Allen Payne, 32, at the Dome.  He took them to the 3500 block of Helms in Culver where he dug up a glass jar containing the checks and jewelry.  The real mystery is what she was doing with that sort of booty in her purse.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3259/2640171574_f87b21c32f_o.gif" alt="afbarshoot" align="left" height="62" width="204" /><b>March 11, 1961</b>.  Alfred Carrillo, 33, was a Dome resident in good standing who had the bad luck to be sitting in a bar at 301 South Hill Street one early Friday morning.  Victor F. Jimenez, 26, unemployed truck driver, shot Alfred and then drove off, later to be arrested at his home.  (The bar at 301 South Hill, by the way, was the bar at the base of Angels Flight‚Äìseen here with Lon Chaney Jr. in the 1956 outing <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/indestructible_man" title="IM" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>Indestructible Man</i></a>üôÇ</p>

That‚Äù<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="‚Ñ¢" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s what we have for now.  Can‚Äù<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="‚Ñ¢" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t promise it‚Äù<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="‚Ñ¢" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s the last of it, as tales and details may still bubble up from the cracked core of time.  What about you?  Remember your great aunt Nell?  The one you socked away at Shady Pines?  (The rest home, not the cemetery.)   She may harbor descriptions of devious Dome debauchery from back in the day.  Go find out before you have to shift Shady Pines.</p>
